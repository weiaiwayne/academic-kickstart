As a Christian who happens to be a professor, I use this section of the website to share books and podcasts that have shaped my faith in God and to stimulate a conversation about faith and social science. 

**Faith and academia are never separate realms**. As a social scientist, I trust that empirical data give us insights about regularities in life, but, faith provides the ultimate metanarrative about the meanings of life, work, and relationships. I study internet society and how citizens come together to fight social ills. Faith can explain such resilience and grace of human race because we are created in [Godâ€™s image](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1%3A27&version=NIV). As I also research the dark side of the internet society, including things such as hate, distrust, polarization, segregation, disinformation, and propaganda, I have perhaps more data to show the ultimate fall of human race: the sins of our self-centeredness and pride, the futility of social engineering and technological revolutions. I believe neither democratic platform nor sound social policy can save us from an age of hate and ignorance, albeit they can be helpful at times. The true reconciliation comes through [amending our relationship with our Creator](https://www.biblica.com/bible/niv/ephesians/2/). Below I list resources that have shaped my thinking over the past three years.
