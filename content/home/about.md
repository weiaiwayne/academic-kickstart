# Biography

He employs computational models to identify key players, influential spheres, and prominent topics in online political conversations. His work aims to foster a global public sphere that is open, vibrant, and robust, capable of countering the threats of democratic backsliding and authoritarianism.

# What is CuriosityBits CC for?

I built this site to share open-source content created in my research and teaching. You will find interactive tutorials on using R to collect, analyze, and visualize social media data, copies to my recent publications, and a repository for past data visualization projects. Please note that I no longer provide updates to the data science courses I teach through this website. If you are interested in taking my data science courses, please reach out to me directly.
