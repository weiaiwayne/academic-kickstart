Not only is this a win for the American people, but its broader implications will benefit people across the globe. This is historic, life-saving, and climate-mitigating legislation that will provide us with cheaper electrification and cleaner air. After a tough year of losses for climate, the United States is finally turning a corner with a bill that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated 40 percent by 2030.

Although a win, there are terrible tradeoffs at the heart of the Inflation Reduction Act. It keeps us tied to fossil fuels when better alternatives exist. Painful concessions to fossil fuel interests will hurt communities of color and poor families at the same time others celebrate progress. We believe no community should suffer so another can keep the lights on, and we’ll fight to end of the terrible sacrifice zones in regions like the Gulf South.  Everyone has the right to #CleanAir.

157 years ago, on June 19, 1865, over 250,000 Black people were enslaved in Galveston, Texas -- two years after the Emancipation Proclamation was signed. History shows us Black people in the United States and globally have struggled to realize true freedom and equality to this day. 

In our climate fight, we've committed to shining light on injustices and inequalities Black people within our communities face daily. In order for change to happen, we all must work to dismantle the systems of racism that continue to rob people of true justice and freedom. Like climate change, our time to act is now.

The Clean Air Act of 1970 proved that by setting tight standards on emissions and air quality, we could improve life for Americans, save trillions in health care costs, and boost the economy while saving the planet. 
 
The Clean Water act of 1972 ensured high standards for water infrastructure, waste management, and lake restoration, eliminating toxic chemicals (often produced from the work of Big Oil) from our water systems. No one has ever complained about their drinking water being too clean before or since! 
 
When the need for breathable air and drinkable water for vulnerable communities is valued above the greed of Big Polluters to destroy our climate for profit, that’s climate justice.

And it’s not “normal.” 🔥
(Repost @nytimes, source: https://nyti.ms/33J3C0D) 

・・・
There’s a new definition of ‘normal’ for weather, and the U.S. is getting warmer.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration last week issued its latest “climate normals”: baseline data of temperature, rain, snow and other weather variables collected over three decades at thousands of locations across the country.

The temperature results (pictured here) are in keeping with what we’ve long known: that the world has warmed by more than 1 degree Celsius (about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) since 1900, and that the pace of warming has accelerated in recent decades. As for precipitation changes, the maps reveal America’s split personality — some regions, notably the Southwest, are becoming increasingly drier, while the Central and Eastern parts of the country are getting wetter.

The normals are computed using 30 years of data and the newest ones include data from 1991 to 2020. Updated every 10 years, the normals are used by TV meteorologists when they tell you that today’s blisteringly high temperature was 10 degrees above normal for that location and date, for instance, or that a single heavy downpour brought more rain than is typical for an entire month. 

The normals are invaluable to farmers, energy companies and other businesses, water managers, transportation schedulers and any one who plans their activities in coming weeks or months based on what is likely, weather-wise.

“What we’re trying to do with climate normals is put today’s weather in the proper context,” said Michael Palecki, who manages the project at NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information. The change is especially drastic between the new normals and the previous ones, from 2010. “Almost every place in the U.S. has warmed,” he said.",NA,NA,NA,3.16

So far, we’ve awarded $10,000 grants to 19 organizations in 15 states - including Bridging The Gap in Virginia.  

Bridging The Gap in Virginia supports individuals struggling with addiction, incarceration, chronic homelessness, and lack of employability, and has expanded their mission to address #EnvironmentalJustice and green workforce development.  

You can learn more about @btgvirginia at the link in our bio, and read what its director of operations, Raye Elliott, shared with us below 🌎⤵️

“As a result of fossil fuels, oil and gas projects, and corporations targeting marginalized communities, we are re-focusing and educating the populations that inhabit these areas, of how these fossil fuels affect climate, well water, and the landscape as a whole for communities of color in rural Virginia.

Our focal point is to educate the population on how through renewable energy, green jobs, energy efficiency, and weatherization will help change the mindset promulgated by corporate greed. So with the implementation of our workforce development initiative, we are bringing a cross-sectional education that includes climate change informational sessions, entrepreneurship opportunity training, and workforce development (for both low-income groups and justice involved individuals) with hopes to re-program the minds of the residents that would otherwise be taken advantage of.  

Thanks to Climate Reality’s recent grant award support, we have been able to achieve our goals by creating partnerships with the Town of Dillwyn, the City of Richmond, and county municipalities to expand our outreach as well as local nonprofits. We have been able to conduct educational workshops, provide COVID-19 PPE, provide energy efficiency giftbags, and conduct in-home interviews with residents for our weatherization program. Bridging The Gap in Virginia is immensely grateful for the opportunity to participate in the Climate Reality grant program and would like to reiterate our targeted commitment to climate justice.""",NA,NA,NA,-2.39

When it comes to the climate crisis in 2020, unprecedented extreme weather events have seemingly battered communities around the world week after week. We've seen all too clearly how the climate crisis fuels this destruction. The science is clear: Without urgent, ambitious action to reduce emissions and transition to a global clean energy economy, hurricane seasons like this will become a new normal. 

As we continue to beat back the worsening COVID-19 crisis, we cannot forget that the climate crisis is also an existential threat to our health, safety, and security, especially for the world’s most vulnerable communities and groups. In order to rebuild our economies, protect our health, and safeguard our future, our recovery from the pandemic must be bound together with taking climate action.

By the time the waters receded, an estimated 1,833 people had died, millions of people along the Gulf Coast were displaced, and 80 percent of New Orleans had flooded. 
 
But what started as a natural disaster had also become a man-made catastrophe. Its human toll was a direct result of systemic inequities and the types of environmental racism that leave Black and Brown communities in the areas most susceptible to storm damage, with little or no support when disaster strikes. And while hundreds of thousands evacuated, those who were too poor to do so were left to ride out a historic storm. Nearly 2,000 didn’t make it. 
 
After the storm moved on, a slow response operation made matters worse. Residents waited on their rooftops to be rescued. Others waded through dangerous waters in the hopes of finding safety. In the Superdome, evacuees endured dangerous and unsanitary conditions. In many cases, help came far too late — or never came at all. 
 
As climate activists, we know that warming ocean waters will make powerful storms like Hurricane Katrina more common. We’ve seen it this week, as Hurricane Laura’s destructive path tore through the Gulf Coast region once again. 
 
But we must also acknowledge that structural inequalities and entrenched discrimination make communities of color more likely to bear the brunt of the climate crisis. We saw how the Lower Ninth Ward suffered and was abandoned in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina. To honor the legacy of those we lost 15 years ago, we must keep climate justice at the heart of our cause, and do the work needed to dismantle the systems of oppression that have led to suffering and catastrophe time and time again.

This food chain is directly linked to the 70 percent of oxygen we receive into our atmosphere from the ocean.

In it, we explain why global warming doesn't mean the absence of cold weather or snow. 
The simple fact is that climate change throws natural systems out of balance. Since 1950, hot days have become more common and cold days have become less common around the world. In the US, record-high temperatures are being set more than twice as often as record-cold temperatures. 
The bottom line is this: “Less cold” doesn’t mean “never cold.” Cold days – and the snowstorms that come with them – will happen less often as the world warms, but they won’t go away.",NA,NA,NA,1.88

Brazil is the country with the most biodiversity in the world. But we are also the champions of forest fires.

We wash the flag to get rid of the blood of all beings, humans and other living beings that are being murdered for economic gains in our country.

#climateemergency #amazonforest #juststopoil @extinctionrebellionbrasil #savetheamazon #climateactivist

O Brasil é o país com a maior biodiversidade do mundo. No entanto, somos também campeões em desmatamento e queimadas. Desde que os primeiros colonizadores chegaram aqui, perdemos muito de nossas florestas e espécies. A Mata Atlântica, bioma que cobre 15% do território nacional, foi praticamente varrida do mapa. Segundo dados da Fundação SOS Mata Atlântica, hoje restam pouco mais de 12% de sua área original.

A Floresta Amazônica, infelizmente, segue pelo mesmo caminho. Já perdeu mais de 20% de seu território - parte significativa disso só nos últimos 4 anos, devido a um governo irresponsável cujo líder declarou ter interesse apenas em sua riqueza mineral, desconsiderando por completo sua biodiversidade e as populações indígenas que ali habitam. Populações essas, aliás, que ajudam a proteger a floresta.

Lavamos a bandeira para lavar o sangue de todos os seres, humanos e não-humanos, massacrados pelo descaso e pelo interesse exclusivamente econômico em nossas matas. Por Bruno Pereira, Dom Phillips e tantos outros que se foram nas mãos desse governo genocida e ecocida. Resistimos para existirmos!

Yesterday activists from a collaboration of groups took action in London in solidarity with activists in the DRC against the oil auctions happening today and yesterday 🇨🇩.

They handed in a letter to the DRC embassy, and also visited BP and Shell (who announced record profits yesterday) warning them not to invest in the auction. 

Voices were raised through placards with messages from DRC activists and speeches. Clear messages were shared to cancel debt and provide reparations and climate finance for a just transition to a resilient and peaceful Congo.

'Buy every politician, every system' and delay action on the climate crisis.

Emissions from the burning of fossil fuels are the main contributors to the climate emergency, something that oil companies have known for decades.

To keep to 1.5c means that oil companies alone would have to forgo $100 trillion in profit which is why they have done everything possible to stop all efforts to switch to our energy systems.

We are suffering at 1.2C of warming. The huge cost of power is crippling people all over the world. Oil rich nations deliberately obstruct supply to drive up prices too.

So are we going to continue paying through the nose for something that is killing us and killing our planet, or are we going to do something about it?

This morning medical professionals have broken the windows of @jpmorgan to protest the continuing financing of new fossil fuel developments.

This is a peaceful act of civil disobedience.

Why?

The next few days bring unprecedented deadly heat to the UK and the Met office has issued its first ever extreme heat red warning.

Despite these impacts of continued fossil fuel burning and climate breakdown JP Morgan is still funding new fossil fuel developments.

The climate crisis can’t wait we need to act now as Dr Elena McKeown, fmr chair of the @thebma BMA make clear the climate emergency is a health emergency - forging a path to net zero has never been more important.

Leading medical journal the Lancet says ‘climate change is the greatest global health threat facing the world in the 21st-century but it is also the greatest opportunity to redefine the social and environmental determinants of health’

A report by @unicef UNICEF published last year describes how already over 1 billion children’s lives are at extremely high risk from climate breakdown.

Gov.uk state ‘Tackling the climate climate crisis as a health determinant is a crucial aspect of the role of health and care professionals’

What, when governments and investments refuse to act on repeat scientific warnings?

We protest as a considered last resort as medical professionals we have sworn oath to protect public health.

We are proud to step into long tradition of medical protest to defend lives.

The Global North braces for some of the hottest temperatures ever recorded (up to 40C/104F in some areas) in the coming days. You see, back in 2020 the UK Meteorological Office using long-range climate models made a mock-up weather forecast to see what kind of temperatures we would be facing in 2050. Well the plausible has become a reality three decades early. 

When people are exposed to extreme heat, they can suffer from potentially deadly illnesses, such as heat exhaustion and heat stroke.

The Goverment isn’t responding to the crisis today or building a better future. ⁣
⁣
Any fool can see that 2050 is too late for net zero. It's time to share the science, and stand up for the billions of lives at stake, if we fail to act like it's an emergency.⁣

‘Don’t auction Congo’s Peatlands’
‘No oil exploration in the Congo Basin’

Use the hashtags #CongoFossilFree and #DontAuctionCongoPeatlands and tag @xr_universite_de_goma in your posts.

Cabinet ministers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have approved the auction of 16 land blocks for oil extraction worth $650bn at the end of July, including peatlands that form some of the world’s most important carbon sinks.
 

The land will be auctioned to oil giants on the 28th and 29th of July 2022.
• A significant proportion of the blocks overlap with the world’s largest tropical peatland complex in the Congo Basin.  

• The Congo Basin is the world’s second largest carbon sink after the Amazon.
• The peatland stores approximately 30 billion tons of carbon - equivalent to about 82% of annual global carbon dioxide emissions.

Unequal development pathways imposed by appropriation of Congo’s wealth has created $11 billion of official Congolese debt

Until the debt is cancelled the Congo will be reliant on fossil fuel extraction to create revenue to pay off the interest.

Anxiety and Alienation
Navigating Your Relationships in an Age of Climate Crisis
Wednesday, June 08, 2022 by Neil Simpson @nrichsimps 
with original artwork by Dustin Jacobus @solarpunkart 

The climate and ecological crisis smashes around inside my head like rocks in a washing machine. 

When I hit general anxiety overflow, my family and friends usually help me to express myself, and I feel better. When it comes to eco-anxiety, however, my experience is often different.

I feel adrift and alienated in my feelings for an issue that does not warrant alienation. I began to wonder: how many other people feel this way? There must be loads of us.

Capitalism necessitates individualisation so that we continue consuming. If my anxiety regarding the climate and ecological crisis is regarded as a problem within me, an individual, I can be sold solutions. 

If members of your personal collective aren’t willing to confront the enormous threat that the climate crisis represents, it is crucial that you find like-minded communities. 

Try not to pull away from those you love, despite how they make you feel when you talk about the climate and ecological crisis. As Joanna Macy says, “Of all the dangers we face, from climate change to nuclear wars, none is so great as the deadening of our response.”

Ons Kick-Off protest begon in de regen, maar het klaarde al snel op. Prachtige speeches en een fossiele dans zetten de Walk of Resistance goed in. 

Op het eerste stoppunt hielden we een begrafenis van onze moeder: Moeder Aarde. Begeleid met vioolmuziek rouwden wij om alles wat we nu al hebben verloren en we vervolgden ons protest met een stille tocht. 

Op het volgende stoppunt was er een die-in met een krachtige speech over de schade die de fossiele industrie de aarde allemaal al heeft aangedaan. Daarna vervolgden wij onze tocht om te eindigen bij OASE om samen te eten en te ontspannen. 

Want dit was pas de eerste dag. Morgen staat er nog veel te wachten. 

Bedankt aan iedereen die mee heeft gelopen, heeft gesproken, of anders heeft bijgedragen aan dit prachtige Kick-Off Protest van de Rebellie tegen de Fossiele Industrie. 

We zijn begonnen. Tot morgen.

BREAKING ! ACTIVISTS DISRUPT AFRICA ENERGIES SUMMIT​​​​​​​ IN MAYFAIR, LONDON DEMANDING AN END TO OIL COLONIALISM.

A coalition of groups including  XR Africa, Sustaining the Wild Coast, StopEACOP, African's Rising, The Green Connection, Oceans Not Oil, Jubilee for Climate, XR UK, XRY, 350.org and Greenpeace UK have disrupted day one of the Africa Energies Summit in London. The group hung 'END OIL COLONIALISM' and 'JUSTICE FOR AFRICA' banners and blockaded the doors to the 5-star hotel. Voice recordings from African activists were played and placards displayed with messages from activists from South Africa, Namibia, Nigeria, the DRC and Uganda. 

The summit is sponsored by oil giants Shell, Total, ReconAfrica, Perenco and Schlumberger and more, all who have published record profits in the last quarter and continue to sign new oil deals in debt-burdened African nations, who have contributed the least to the climate crisis, yet suffer the consequences of fossil fuel exploitation the most. 

Continued oil exploitation in Africa is a form of neo-colonialism, with governments tied into making oil deals due to crippling debt repayments to Global North countries, and the majority of oil profit going to companies from the Global North. New fossil fuel projects tie the world into emissions that we can't afford, and communities on the ground into suffering rather than benefting from exploitation. 

Only 55% of Africans have electrcity and only 2% of global renewable energy investment is in Africa. Limiting global heating to 1.5ºC means 7 x the current investment into renewables in Africa. Africa needs a #JustTransition to renewable energy.

Sie wurde von Doug Francisco und Justine Squire von Bristols “Invisible Circus” für die erste Rebellions Woche von Extinction Rebellion UK im April 2019 in London entwickelt und geht auf eine Zeitlupen-Pantomime Show aus den 90er Jahren zurück. Damals ganz in Weiß gekleidet begleiteten die geisterhaften Darsteller auch Friedensproteste, beispielsweise 2003 während der Demonstrationen gegen den Irak Krieg.

Die Wahl von Rot als Rebellions-Farbe ist teils ästhetisch, teils symbolisch zu erklären, indem Rot für das Leben und das Blut, was alles Lebendige vereint, aber auch für Leidenschaft und Gefahr steht. Das bewusst langsame Dahinschreiten, die wehenden roten Tücher und die maskenhaft geschminkten Gesichter sorgen für einen starken Kontrast zu den traditionell lauten, ungeordneten Straßenprotesten. Die Performance kreiert ein Momentum des Innehaltens und schafft mitten auf der Straße Raum für die Trauer, die viele von uns angesichts der Klimakrise und des Artensterbens erfüllt. So begleiten die Red Rebels viele Aktionen von Extinction Rebellion und anderen Umweltaktivisten, sorgen für eine starke Bildsprache, sind aber ebenso ausgleichend und befriedend wirksam.

Mittlerweile haben sich Red Rebels Gruppen in vielen Ländern der Welt gegründet. Sie bestehen aus engagierten Menschen ohne speziell künstlerischen oder performativen Hintergrund, nähen sich die Kostüme in der Regel selber und üben die Bewegungen gemeinsam nach den Lehr-Videos der Gründer ein. Jede und jeder ist willkommen, der/die diese Art des nonverbalen, künstlerischen Protestes für sich entdecken möchte!

We’re heartbroken by the devastating news in the U.S. 

The leaked draft opinion obtained by POLITICO from the U.S. Supreme Court indicting the overturning of Roe v. Wade is nothing short of an assault on human rights. Once officially published, the ruling's immediate impact would end federal protections of abortion rights, leaving it up to individual states to decide a person’s right to choose what to do with their body. 

To be clear, like many unruly laws in the U.S., this overturning is a direct attack on low-income, working-class communities of color that will be most impacted by the decision. This is the case for many of the crises we’re currently facing. The effects go to show just how intertwined these issues really are—all operating under a patriarchal, capitalist system prioritizing power, control, and capital over human lives. 

Fighting for reproductive rights means fighting for LGBTQIA+ rights, worker rights, Indigenous rights, and yes—the right to a clean and healthy environment for all.

- the declaration of an emergency for the climate and biodiversity by the government, 
- the complete stop of greenhouse gas emissions by 2025 
- the establishment of local, cantonal, national and international citizens' assemblies. 

We believe that for many people, especially families, participation in demonstrations or acts of rebellion is sometimes logistically complicated. Their concerns remain unheard. We hope by this action to relay their existential preoccupations for the future and their wish to favour life.

It is around these questions that the XR Families group was born.

Today marks the 12 year memorial of British Petroleum’s Deepwater Horizon — the largest oil spill in American history. For 85 days, the Earth bled 4.9 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico.

It was an assault to wildlife, we lost so much. 3/4 of pregnant bottlenose dolphins miscarried that year, and 2-5 trillion young fish, 8 billion oysters, and 50% of coastal biodiversity died.

The fallacy that we can control nature, and that we should want to, was revealed. The oil company responsible for the disaster took little precaution, boasted the depths they drilled for that well, and still denounce the long-term effects.

As the Earth bled hydrocarbons that would poison the water and decimate the fisheries that rely on the Gulf, Tony Hayward, former chief of BP, shrugged and said “it’s a very big ocean.”

11 people died on the rig that day, doing the unseen “dirty work” that our economy runs on.

At last, in its sixth report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change acknowledged colonialism as a historical and ongoing driver of the climate crisis.

A large part of this landmark conclusion is driven by the fact that more social scientists, scientists of color, and women scientists were involved than in previous reports. The IPCC also engaged with more Indigenous authors—covering Indigenous knowledge in every chapter of the working group two report on the human impacts of climate change.

The @ipcc’s mention of colonialism shows how intersectionality can not only create more historically accurate climate reports—but also drive more well-rounded climate adaptation and mitigation efforts.

Leaving more than 20 injured from the community, including pregnant women and children, this same community was displaced from its territory due to the armed conflict more than 1 year ago. Seeking a solution to their situation, they fled to Bogotá, the administrative, legislative and political center, to request a solution from the state entities. However, during their stay they have been the object of persecution by the mayor's office, not allowing them to stay in the public space or giving a solution for their safe return to the territory.

The forced displacement due to conflict is a dynamic that has been repeated with different indigenous peoples (and farmers) of Colombia who are displaced for the development of extractivism projects, including mining and industrial projects in their territory and even the cultivation of coca leaves by government-tied groups[0], the Colombian State has allowed this to continue to happen even with the tools to protect the reservations and even stop the armed conflict, going completely contrary to the statements made by the World Resources Institute (WRI) that states that 80% of indigenous lands are carbon sinks necessary to counteract the climate crisis[1] and the Peace agreement.

Not only displacement is enough, more than 81 indigenous people were murdered in Cauca as of October 2021 [2] and more than 122 massacres were seen in the 3 departments with the largest presence of indigenous peoples in Colombia[3].

The violent response by the police against yesterday's Embera demonstration in Bogotá belongs to the systematic persecution of defenders of the environment and life in the country with more environmental leaders assassinated.

It is vital for human health around the world that we get off fossil fuels as soon as possible in a just & fair transition for everyone. Failure to reach 1.5C would mean a 'catastrophic harm to health that will be impossible to reverse' -so said the @NEJM @BMJ @Lancet

The UK is giving millions of pounds of public money to Oil majors like Shell and BP through tax incentives. This means the UK takes barely $2/barrel in tax compared to Norway which takes over $20/barrel.

Taking that money back, from Oil and Gas companies record profits, we could power up our clean energy supply, fund an insulation drive, and support the poorest people through the energy crisis. 

“Climate activists are sometimes depicted as dangerous radicals,but the truly dangerous radicals are the countries that are increasing the production of fossil fuels. Investing in new fossil fuel infrastructure is moral & economic madness”- Antonio Guterres, UN Secretary General

This morning, scientists calling for radical change in the face of the climate and ecological crisis took nonviolent direct action at the London headquarters of Shell, as part of the world’s largest ever scientist-led civil disobedience campaign. The group used modified fire extinguishers to spray biodegradable fake oil on the building, as well as posting relevant scientific papers to the walls.

The action comes two days after the latest IPCC report is released, with Jim Skea, a professor at Imperial College London and co-chair of the working group behind the report, stating that it is “now or never, if we want to limit global warming to 1.5C.”

The emissions of these companies in the harbor is 8 (!) times that of the city itself. 

Despite this, they are not bound by the City of Ghent to an ambitious climate or energy plan. Only a few of them make a meagre effort to reach climate neutrality, whilst contributing to climate change by lobbying against regulations and greenwashing their activities. They do this with billions worth of subsidies (e.g. in the form of ‘free emission rights'), leading to gigantic profit taking which benefits their shareholders. These handouts to the rich continue at the cost of the taxpayer, and in the meantime CO2-emissions only keep rising.

Current policies are unjust and deadly, threatening the future of humankind. It is high time to develop a genuinely ambitious climate plan for the port of Ghent and heavy industry and implement it as quickly as possible! The responsibility for developing and implementing this plan rests with the City of Ghent’s municipal government, North Sea Port and other stakeholders, with wide-ranging involvement of the citizens of Ghent.

 We therefore demand to:

❗️TELL PEOPLE THE TRUTH: about the enormous emissions of the port, and that we need to stop burning coal, oil and gas as fast as possible to lessen the damage due to climate change. 
❗️ACT NOW: ban fossil fuels in the port as quickly as possible, and become energy neutral.
❗️ACT FAIRLY: all citizens and companies shoulder the burden.
❗️ACT DEMOCRATICALLY: set up Citizen’s Assemblees of ordinary citizens of Ghent and involve them in developing environmental policies.

We perform this act of civil disobedience today because the urgency of the climate crisis demands it. The clock is ticking, and climate chaos, which already causes death on a massive scale, is only set to increase. Inaction is criminal! 💪 @xr_gent

Lawan privatisasi air! Air milik bersama.

Air merupakan kebutuhan yang fundamental dan bagian tak terpisahkan dari kehidupan semua makhluk hidup. Resolusi 64/292 Majelis Umm PBB secara tegas menyebutkan bahwa hak atas air dan sanitasi yang bersih adalah bagian dari Hak Asasi Manusia dan
merupakan salah satu komponen terpenting bagi keberlanjutan hidup serta hak hidup.

Resolusi 64/292 Majlis Umm PBB secara eksplisit juga menyebutkan bahwa negara mesti secara progresif merealisasikan kewajiban hak asasi manusia terkait dengan akses terhadap air bersih dan sanitasi dengan segala instrumen kelembagaan dan kebijakan yang negara miliki. Kewajiban ini meliputi pemenuhan hak, penyediaan layanan, pemberian akses termasuk pemulihan yang efektif terhadap pelanggaran hak atas air pada warga negara.

Hanya saja, semakin menguatnya paradigma neoliberal dalam kebijakan negara yang bertumpu pada pembesaran kapital dan penguatan peran sektor privat yang dimediasi oleh pasar dalam penyediaan layanan barang publik dan hak-hak dasar, termasuk air, dalam praktiknya membuat hak dan akses warganegara atas air yang bersih dan sehat menjadi semakin terabaikan. Kebijakan neoliberal ini utamanya ditunjukkan oleh semakin meluasnya praktik privatisasi air serta kelalaian negara untuk memastikan bahwa tingkat pokok minimum hak atas air telah dinikmati oleh setiap warganegara. Kondisi ini berakibat pada semakin memburuknya persoalan akses dan hak atas air, utamanya bagi kelompok- kelompok sosial yang marjinal.

air adalah sumber kehidupan, sehingga pemerintah wajib menempatkan air bukan sebagai objek yang dikenai harga secara ekonomi. Air merupakan bagian dari hak asasi sehingga keadaan ekonomi seseorang tidak boleh menghalangi mereka untuk mendapatkan air.

Selain it dampak serius perubahan iklim mengancam ketersediaan air bersih di Indonesia. Perubahan pola curah hujan, kenaikan suhu, kenaikan muka air, dan kejadian iklim ekstrem akan menyebabkan krisis air bersih apabila perubahan iklim tidak ditangani secara serius.

Action at the Citigroup headquarters as employees walked into work on the morning of the bank’s Investor Day. Citi is the second largest funder of fossil fuel companies among all global banks and the largest US funder of coal, the dirtiest and most destructive source of energy on the planet. 

The latest United Nations’ IPCC report says that many of the impacts of global warming are now simply irreversible, and humans and nature are being pushed beyond their abilities to adapt. Deeper and faster cuts to greenhouse gas emissions are the only way to limit catastrophic warming. 

Although Citi has demonstrated that it is willing to go further than any other US bank by releasing a net zero pathway with absolute emission reduction targets, the plan does not entail how Citi will step away from the actual cause of climate chaos: fossil fuels.

Citi needs to commit to ending fossil fuel expansion and setting concrete, time bound targets now.

Heute Früh haben Aktivist*innen in Wien an 3 Stellen gegen den Import von Öl & Gas aus Russland protestiert:
Am Wiener Schwarzenbergplatz (wo die neue Zentrale des russ. Ölkonzerns @lukoil_austria entsteht), am Ring an der Wiener Staatsoper (Sponsor ist @omv) und am Naschmarkt.

Ihr Statement: ""Die Abhängigkeit von fossiler Energie (Kohle, Öl & Gas) ist eine existenzielle Bedrohung für Frieden und Klima.""

Dabei schließen sie sich dem Aufruf von @rebellionua (Extinction Rebellion Ukraine) an, die in einem offenen Brief zum Widerstand gegen ""fossile-fueled terror"" aufrufen.

Sie erklären in ihrem Statement: ""Wir können nicht zulassen, dass die Profite österreichischer Banken und Konzerne über das Recht der ukrainischen Bevölkerung gestellt werden, in einem freien und demokratischen Land selbstbestimmt zu leben.""

“Putin glaubt, er könne uns erpressen,"" so eine Demonstrantin. ""Er glaubt, wir Menschen im Westen seien zu bequem und zu verweichlicht, um ohne sein Blut-Öl und Blut-Gas auszukommen. Aber da irrt er sich gewaltig. Zeigen wir Putin, dass auch wir mit Einschränkungen leben können. Dass wir mit weniger Öl und Gas auskommen können, und dass wir dazu alle unseren Beitrag leisten. Geben wir Grundbedürfnissen den Vorrang – Wärme für alle statt Luxus für wenige!”

Ook roepen wij gemeentes, bedrijven en instellingen die zaken doen met Gazprom op om hiermee te stoppen.
Door onze afhankelijkheid van fossiele brandstoffen dragen we niet alleen bij aan de klimaat- en ecologische crisis, maar ook aan gewapende conflicten zoals bijvoorbeeld die in de Oekraïne, Yemen, Syrië en Irak. Vandaag stonden we één minuut stil bij deze conflicten, de oorlog en alle slachtoffers hiervan.

Slides 5-7 - Youth in London were joined by Samba Band and passers by in calling the Tanzanian High Commission to take a stance against the evictions, playing videos by the community and then visited Kuoni and Trailfinders to speak out against violations of human rights and Indigenous peoples rights 

Slides 8-9 - Youth in Edinburgh @ediyouthinresistance visit @kuonitravel and @trailfindersuk to relay to the agencies that they can support Maasai rights to their ancestral lands!

Slide 10 - @xryouthsheffield and @xrshef join digitally and stand in solidarity

🌱

WHAT WE LEARNED: the global family is united in the fight against oppression and the criminality of violence. Solidarity is an act of recognition of this truth. What is happening to the Maasai right now is happening to countless of communities across the world, all to the benefit of the few at the expense of the many. 

Only true people’s power will create justice in our name- that is what our generation is called to achieve.

The Disproportionate Impact Climate Change Has On Women’s Health.

From supercharging extreme weather events to boosting the spread of infectious diseases, climate change is already having a huge impact on human health across the world.
But this impact is not being felt equally. A growing body of research suggests that the world’s most disadvantaged people are also the most vulnerable to the health impacts of climate change and the least likely to be able to adapt.
Gender is just one of many factors that can influence a person’s standing in society. This in-depth explainer looks into how climate change can have differing impacts on the health of men and women around the world.

👉🏻 El 8 d'octubre del 2021, el Dia Mundial del Pop, es va publicar un nou informe que revela vuit raons per les quals la cria industrial de pops és cruel, perjudicial per al planeta i ha de ser detinguda.

🐙 Els pops són animals complexos, intel·ligents i sensibles, molt coneguts pels seus vuit braços i les seves sorprenents capacitats cognitives. Els estudis han demostrat que els pops aprenen amb facilitat, poden resoldre problemes, fins i tot utilitzar eines i tenen la capacitat fascinant de canviar d'aspecte i mimetitzar-se en el seu medi.

Hier, des rebelles d’Extinction Rebellion Charleroi ont pris possession du canal Charleroi-Bruxelles pour dénoncer les crimes d’écocide dont Syngenta se rend coupable en exportant massivement des pesticides interdits en Europe 🇪🇺

☠️ Leur toxicité n’est plus à démontrer. Syngenta, la Belgique et l’Europe font chaque jour des victimes de ce commerce au-delà de leurs frontières.

La Belgique est un des principaux exportateurs de néonicotinoïdes, des pesticides tueurs de biodiversité, via le port d’Anvers. C’est à Seneffe, sur notre territoire, que se trouve la plus grosse usine européenne du groupe Syngenta, le géant suisse de la semence et de l’agrochimie et principal exportateur de ces néonicotinoïdes.

Heute morgen ist das russische Militär völkerrechtswidrig in die Ukraine einmarschiert. Der Krieg sorgt für Elend, Leid und Tod und die Fluchtbewegung hat erst begonnen.

SAUBERES GAS IST EINE TÖTLICHE LÜGE

Das Russische Militär wird über den Verkauf und zuletzt besonders durch die Preisdiktatur von fossilen Brennstoffen finanziert. Das  ist seit Jahren der Fall und keine Neuigkeit - auch nicht für die deutsche Regierung. Somit wiegt die verschleppte Energiewende auf deutscher Seite schwer. Aus klimazerstörerischen Gas wird jetzt Tod und Elend in der Ukraine.

Unsere Solidarität ist mit den betroffenen Menschen in der Ukraine.

Domani, il Piemonte, avrà il suo Consiglio Regionale aperto sullo stato di emergenza ecoclimatica e sulle azioni necessarie per poterla affrontare.

G20 (Group of 20). An intergovernmental forum of 19 nations + EU, representing 60% of worlds population and 80% of the worlds GDP, also 80% of the worlds emissions.

Over the years, the G20 have a single focus: (GDP-based) economic growth. And this has translated to aggressive investment in extractive industries around the world, ranging from oil, gas, coal, mining, plantation, infrastructure, weaponry, petrochemicals and other destructive practices that systemically rapes earth, robs land from indigenous communities and causes the climate crisis.

The worst part? Doing all this while acting like they are world ""leaders"" that will save us from the climate crisis, offering fake greenwashing solutions using our money, all the while continuing the destructive practices supported by taxpayers money.

Enough is enough. We cannot expect the people that cause climate crisis to come out with policies needed to get out of it.

Speak up. Join the movement. Act now. We need that system change ASAP

It will be easy to forget this weekend when the sun comes out and the wind dies down, but every year Eunice and Franklin will be coming back with their uglier friends. 

This is why, in between these storms, we have demanded the city #RED010. We have over-drafted the environment and it is essential that we begin to pay into this debt with climate neutral policies by 2025. 

In March we will be electing the final city council that can make meaningful policies to save the climate from a worsening catastrophe. Take Eunice and Franklin as a
warning of what is to come - it is time to #RED010!
We are grateful to all of our rebels, fellow activists, and political agents that joined us over the weekend outside city hall demanding change. We showed off our rebel style in a anti-fashion show, marched through the city chanting our demands, and hosted a protest festival. Saving Rotterdam is not only about adjusting policy from the top down, but creating a climate focused culture from the
bottom up.

With this in mind, we brought Rotterdammers in from the streets. It is our demand that we Let Citizens Decide on climate policies, throwing out career politicians looking for an oil dredged euro and lobbyist, the 1st world word for ""corruption"". Our citizens' assembly demonstrated the real sentiment of Rotterdam: Climate Neutral Housing NOW! Big thanks to @tramhaus.rtm for the anthems
and dancing!

We might be shocked to discover that when looking at income and emissions on a global scale, many of us living in the Global North are actually some of the wealthiest in the world—but there's still a huge disparity between the relatively wealthy and the super-rich. The top 1% of earners globally emit an average of 121 tons of greenhouse gases a year while the top 0.01% emit 2,700 tons over the same period.

The more money someone has, the more likely they are to consume and emit greenhouse gases. Owning multiple cars, avoiding public transport, flying several times a year—sometimes on private jets or even rocket ships—all contribute to the rich's out-of-this-world emissions.

While we should all be mindful of how we consume, we also need to hold society's most-polluting accountable and put pressure on policymakers to limit emissions.

📆 4 sessions total on Weds & Fris, 2nd & 18th of both Feb & March, 7PM GMT

🥊 The next stage of fighting the Policing Bill (among others!) will involve targeting specific MP's to convince them not to dismantle what's left of democracy in the UK.

Want to learn empowering & impactful new tactics for lobbying MP's & Lords around the Policing Bill, the Nationality & Borders Bill, or any of the authoritarian legislation making its way through Parliament (Health + Care Act, Elections Bill, Official Secrets Act, Online Safety Bill, Judicial Review Bill, British Bill of Rights/Scrapping the Human Rights Act)?

These tactics still include traditional lobbying (securing meetings with MP's) and also non-traditional, ""enhanced lobbying"" methods of confronting MP's with carefully-formulated questions wherever they may be (on the street, out to dinner, etc). The latter methods involve recording the Parliamentarian on video to document their response and thank them (or otherwise ) on social media.

🎁 For: Anyone who isn't shy at the though of speaking directly to MP's (in some cases, whether they want us to be or not). This isn't about being shouty-activist-confrontational. The less intimidating we look/behave, the greater the likelihood we'll secure an actual conversation, even if they're not expecting it.

MP's in particular are, after all, public servants. Sometimes they forget this. It's up to us to remind them.

💥 Check out the excerpt from the Birddog Nation documentary https://buff.ly/3ofJRbQ to see how it's done!

💥 This is a practical training evening—

💡 1). Please bring an idea for something you'd like to lobby an MP about.
📝 2). Please be prepared to take notes.

By the end of the evening you should have a strong question formulated and ready to deploy.

The Metals Company (@metals.co) is planning to use its UN International Seabed Authority (ISA) 'license' to explore the deep seabed, to find out if metals can be mined – but we all know this is just a greenwashing exercise to make sure they can mine the Clarion Clipperton Fracture Zone (CCFZ) in the Pacific Ocean in two years time.

This ISA license will allow them to mine an area one third the size of Belgium, stripping it of all life (they claim they will delicately remove the top surface – but if you look at the machines they use you'll soon see this is a lie). This CANNOT be allowed to happen.

There's a growing list of companies refusing to use deep sea mined metals; it's very long and increasing weekly. Recently BMW, Volkswagen, Volvo and Scania have been joined by Renault. You can see the full list here: https://www.defendthedeep.org

The Metals Company must stop their absurd plans NOW. 

It's time to tell the truth about how destructive deep sea mining will be, how totally  unnecessary it is and why it can never be (nor could ever be) part of our future - especially when we know the next generation of batteries won't need the minerals that The Metals Company intends to provide.

Yesterday, a pair of Rotterdam rebels joined @theoceanrebellion in a striking and startling action at the terribly large and ironically named ship the ""Hidden Gem"" in the Rotterdam harbor. This is a ship belonging to the Metals Company, a company that wants to go out mining the deep sea. We projected a series of messages on the hull of this monster ship.

Deep Sea Mining will cause irreparable damage to the ecosystem that is important to all marine life and all life on Earth. All life is connected to the ocean. 

Noise from is also a huge problem. Whales and other deep-diving animals rely on sound to hunt prey, sonic prospecting and drilling will prevent this happening, seriously disrupting delicate ecosystems.

Burgers beslissen? Wat betekent dat precies? 
XR Rotterdam eist van de Stad Rotterdam dat ze burgers actief laat meedenken over het oplossen van de klimaatcrisis. We vragen de gemeente om de nodige educatie te geven, zodat iedereen even goed geïnformeerd is, en dat er platform wordt geboden zodat iedereen gemakkelijk en op gelijke voet in discussie kan gaan. Zo kunnen we samen manieren ontdekken om klimaatneutraal te zijn tegen 2025. Helaas heeft de stad nog niet de nodige actie ondernomen, dus is het tijd dat wij laten zien welk stap meer dan welkom is! #burgerberaad 

Als onderdeel van onze #RED010 Stadhuis Actie zullen we ons eigen Burgerberaad houden. Een burgerberaad is een manier om democratie naar de straten van onze stad te brengen. We kunnen laten zien welke actie, in plaats van woorden, we verwachten, en zo beslissen we welke punten er op de agenda moeten komen bij de laatste gemeentelijke vergadering voor de verkiezingen in maart. Burgerberaden hebben in de geschiedenis al hun effectiviteit laten zien bij discussies over abortus, huwelijksgelijkheid, parlementaire regelgeving en strafprocessen. Op 19 februari nodigen we Rotterdammers uit in ons stadhuis-op-de-straat om in discussie te gaan over hoe we alle huizen in de stad op een eerlijke wijze klimaatneutraal maken. Wij hebben flink lopen roepen over de klimaatcrisis de laatste tijd; maar nu is het aan jou om je stem te laten horen en de gemeente te vertellen wat er gedaan moet worden.

Brazil is on fire! 

We are losing biodiversity, killing and displacing wild animals and producing smoke, a lot of smoke. Our forests are adding carbon to the atmosphere instead of absorbing it. 

And, year after year, the situation seems to get worse, and the burning season extends for a longer period.

About 30 years ago, we assumed that our water potential would last forever and today we are paying the bill for our lack of planning and our arrogance, experiencing a water crisis that has everything to do with deforestation, as forests regulate the water cycle.

If it is any consolation, it seems that the country suffers from a double personality: while forests are being wildly burned on the one hand, there are reforestation projects with encouraging results on the other.”

New York City had its first taste of the international rebellion against extinction on the winter of 2019, as part of several coordinated nonviolent direct actions taken around the country to mark XR’s debut in the United States.

The NYC XR chapter met in Central Park for a joyous kick off, from there embarking on a unpermitted march down 5th Ave under the tune of an enthusiastic marching band, flanked by a growing number of NYPD officers. Die-ins and banners took over symbols of corporatism and consumption, arrests were made, and we wrote our name on the streets.

From the very beginning, hearts, minds and hands have stayed on message: We are on this together, and we might be going down but we will not go quietly.

IT’S DO OR DIE FOR THE PLANET EARTH

Dead seals, fish and birds have washed up on the shore covered in oil, while fishing activities in the area have been suspended, the government has said.

An estimated eight barrels of crude oil leaked off the country's central Pacific coast as part of the clean-up process following a bigger spill earlier this month. Spanish energy firm Repsol said a clear-up operation for a major oil spill on the coast near Peru's capital Lima would take until the end of February, in an environmental incident declared a 'catastrophe' by the government. Repsol said it had enlisted fishermen to help clear up the oil.

The government has said Repsol spilled some 6,000 barrels of oil into the ocean last week near its La Pampilla refinery, which the company has blamed on unusual waves triggered by a volcanic eruption in Tonga.

The company has declined to state the magnitude of the spill, saying it's still evaluating the impact.

Agricultores e criadores sofrem ainda os impactos e estima-se que mais de 40% dos municípios baianos foram afetados.

Dona Isa é uma das agricultoras que está enfrentando perdas. Ela e seu marido têm um pequeno sítio onde cultivam legumes e frutas e criam porcos e galinhas. A propriedade foi engolida pela água, que destruiu a plantação e quase provocou a morte de animais.

Por outro lado, há muita solidariedade na região, pois veterinários e biólogos estão ajudando a população e os animais.

Segundo dados da Defesa Civil do Estado divulgados na quarta (29/12), 24 pessoas morreram, 53,9 mil ficaram desalojadas e 629 mil foram afetadas de alguma forma pelas enchentes.

Apenas no dia de Natal, a cidade de Ilhéus, uma das localidades mais atingidas, registrou mais chuva (136mm) do que o acumulado durante o mês de dezembro inteiro em 2020 (118mm) e em 2018 (131mm). Os dados são do Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia (Inmet).

Temporais concentrados em poucas horas atingiram dezenas de cidades baianas, como Vitória da Conquista, a quase 5 horas de carro a oeste de Ilhéus. Em 25 de dezembro, o registro de chuvas atingiu a marca de 86,8mm, muito acima do registrado em dezembro passado inteiro (2,6mm).

A CRISE CLIMÁTICA É REAL!

기자회견문 전문 :
지난 해 3월 15일, 우리는 민주당사 입구에서 쇠사슬로 스스로를 묶고 ""기후파괴당 민주당 가덕도 신공항 특별법 철회하라”는 현수막을 펼치는 행동을 벌였다. 그러나 부산시장 보궐 선거를 앞두고 입지선정을 포함한 필수적 절차조차 무시한 채 특별법을 강행통과했던 민주당이 ‘절차’를 지키라며 외면했고, ""법대로 처리해달라""는 민주당의 요청에 따라 6명의 활동가는 사지가 들려 경찰에 연행되었다. 
그리고 작년 말 법원은 약식 재판에서 활동가 6명을 ‘피고인’으로 지칭하며 총 2,000만원의 벌금형을 내렸다. 우리는 이에 불복해 정식 재판을 청구한다. 그래서 가덕도 신공항 특별법을 주도적으로 통과시킨 민주당의 위선과 이에 항의한 우리의 행동과 요구가 정당했음을 재판정 안팎에서 주장할 것이다. 
우리는 우리의 행동 이후 더 악화되고 있는 가덕도 상황에 분노한다. 부산시는 신공항 건설을 넘어 가덕도 입구 생태의 보고인 눌차만까지 콘크리트로 채워 배후 신도시를 조성하겠다는 계획을 발표했다. ‘지역경제 살리기’라는 거짓말로 기업들에 이윤을 보장해주는 대가로 섬과 숲, 바다, 자연 생태계와 지역 공동체마저 무참하게 파괴하려고 한다. 이 와중에 가덕도는 외지인과 토건자본의 투기판이 되어버렸다. 
우리를 더 절망하게 만드는 것은 이것이 가덕도만의 문제가 아니라는 점이다. 정부와 여당, 지자체들은 가덕도 신공항 뿐만 아니라 새만금과 제주도 성산 등에 10여 개의 신공항을 지을 계획을 추진하고 있고 국내외 10여 곳에서 석탄발전소 건설을 강행하는 등 기후생태위기 대응에 역행하는 사업을 계속 벌이고 있다. 전국 곳곳에서는 지역 주민들의 반대에도 핵 폐기장과 고압 송전탑이 들어서고 있고, 재벌 기업의 가스 발전소 건설과 해외 자본을 끌어들인 대규모 해상 풍력 단지 등 기후정의와 에너지 민주주의에 역행하는 일들이 계속 벌어지고 있다.
그럼에도 기후생태위기와 불평등을 극복할 정책을 고민해야 할 대선 시기 주요 후보들은 우리의 기대와 정반대되는 길을 걷고 있다. 온실가스 배출 주범인 기업들에 대한 규제가 강화되어야 하는 때에 민주당 이재명 후보는 기업의 요구에 부응해 ‘기업하기 좋은 규제프리 국가’를 외치고 있고 국민의 힘 윤석열 후보는 탄소감축 목표 하향, 원전 신규 건설, 가덕도 신공항에 대한 예비타당성 조사를 면제와 같은 막말만 늘어놓고 있다. 심지어 기후대통령을 표방하는 정의당 심상정 후보까지 SK의 최태원 회장을 만나 SK의 그린워싱을 꼬집는 대신 그의 ESG 경영을 치켜 세우기까지 했다. 
이처럼 대부분의 정치세력과 기업들이 기후생태위기를 진지하게 대면하지 못하는 때에 시민들의 행동 선택지는 많지 않다. 무책임 권력자들에 저항하는 시민들의 불복종 행동이 확산되는 것은 너무 당연하다. 그렇기에 권력은 시민들의 저항을 연행과 벌금으로 막으려 하고 있다. 얼마전에는 해외 석탄발전소 건설을 하는 두산중공업 로고에 쉽게 지울 수 있는 녹색 수성 페인트를 칠했다는 이유로 두 명의 활동가에게 유죄 확정에 따라 500만원의 벌금형이 선고되기도 했다. 그러나 누가 진정 역사 앞에 ‘피고인’인가? 
우리는 행동에 앞서 발표한 성명서에서 정부가 “입으로는 탄소중립을 말하면서 탄소배출을 늘리는 개발주의 광풍을 불러일으키고 있다” 비판하고 정부와 여당의 “배신과 기후파괴 행위를 지켜만 보지 않을 것”임을 선언했다. 우리는 재판투쟁 과정을 통해 우리의 약속을 지키고자 한다.
다행히 우리는 혼자가 아니다. 기후행동에 참여하는 시민들은 늘고 있고 기후불복종 재판투쟁을 위한 모금 요청에 이틀만에 모금 계좌를 닫아야 할 정도로 많은 시민들이 지지를 보여주었다. 또한 가덕도 신공항 만이 아니라 새만금 신공항, 삼척의 포스코 석탄발전소, 홍천과 횡성의 송전탑, 청주와 합천 등에 지어질 민간 가스발전소 등에 저항하는 흐름도 커지고 있다. 권력을 가진 ‘그들’의 기후생태학살을 막을 방법은 ‘우리’의 힘을 키우는 것이다. 우리의 투쟁은 연결되어있고 기후정의를 위한 더 큰 물결을 만들 수 있음을 우리는 확신한다. 
이에 우리는 법원의 벌금 부과에 불복해 공식 재판을 청구한다. 기후생태위기의 시대에 기후정의를 위한 더 큰 연대를 위하여!

Proprio oggi Ruggero aveva iniziato il suo ottavo giorno di sciopero della fame che lo aveva portato già a perdere più di 5 kg. Ruggero e lə ribelli che lo hanno ogni giorno sostenuto erano ancora a piazza Castello quando è arrivata la notizia.

✒️ Per darvela riproponendo le parole scritte da @xrtorino :
""È con le lacrime agli occhi di Ruggero che abbiamo il piacere di annunciare che, dopo 8 giorni di sciopero della fame, la Regione Piemonte ha accettato la richiesta di convocazione di un consiglio regionale aperto sullo stato di emergenza ecoclimatica. 
Un consiglio aperto per coinvolgere tutte le forze politiche regionali, la comunità scientifica, la società civile e la cittadinanza in un discorso pubblico che non sia guidato da prese di posizione ideologiche. Portiamo in un consiglio regionale aperto ciò che la scienza ci dice con chiarezza che è necessario fare: azzerare le emissioni molto rapidamente e arrestare la devastazione degli ecosistemi e la perdita di biodiversità. Incominciando ora.
La vittoria di Ruggero è solo un piccolo pezzo di un puzzle enorme e terribilmente difficile da ricomporre. Ma è la vittoria di ognunə di noi e di chiunque sia stato al suo fianco in questi giorni difficili.
La vera battaglia inizia domani. 
Per questa ragione, invitiamo tutta la cittadinanza ad un presidio collettivo venerdì 28 gennaio, alle 15h30, sotto il Palazzo della Regione Piemonte. 
Per ripeterlo ancora una volta: la Regione Piemonte ha fallito.""

✊ 🌊Sollevati. Ribellati. Sostieni chi mette il proprio corpo al centro della protesta. Sii parte del cambiamento.
Insieme possiamo vincere questa battaglia epocale.

🎯 Les objectifs ?
- Dénoncer la consommation indécente des ultra-riches, dont les voyages en jet privés ont augmenté de 31 % entre 2005 et 2019 🚀
- Exiger une plus grande participation des plus riches au financements de l’#UrgenceClimatique, écologique ET sociale via des mesures comme l’ISF climatique ou la lutte acharnée contre l’évasion fiscale 💸
- Marquer le début de la présidence française du conseil de l’Union Européenne 👋

✈️ Les vols en jets privés sont 10 à 20 fois plus polluants que les vols dits « commerciaux », et l’aéroport du Bourget est le plus fréquenté d’Europe pour l’aviation d’affaires. Mais on continue à culpabiliser les citoyens à « faire leur part » et à être « éco-responsables ». STOP ! 

❌ Dans le cadre de la présidence française de l’Union Européenne, Emmanuel Macron doit exiger que la taxation du kérosène s’applique aussi sur vols commerciaux que sur les jets privés. 
De nos gouvernants complices de l’inaction climatique, nous exigeons des mesures plus ambitieuses pour contenir les émissions de gaz à effet de serre françaises.

Happening on Twitter Spaces at bit.ly/ktbspace

Writer and Director David Schneider is hosting a talk on the #PolicingBill to listen to people who actually know what they’re talking about from 
@killthebill_official 
 
@extinctionrebellion 
 @united4blacklives 
@majestic_marvina 
@shutitdowntatiana 
So grateful to everyone's hard work to #KillTheBill in the Lords, but if we don't want to lose what we fought so hard to win, we can't slow down now.

8 PM Sunday, 23 Jan, we'll be having a conversation on Twitter with #SpacesHost @davidschneider & co-hosts from the Kill the Bill Official Coalition: @majesticmarvina of @united4blacklives & @blm_leeds & @shutitdowntatiana from @extinctionrebellion & @xrebellion.digital.

Special guests include Nick Anim from Jubilee for Climate & @africans_rising & musical artivist @jameskennedyuk to discuss next steps on the #PolicingBill & end the evening with James' pissed-off, primal protest anthem, ""The Power"". ✊🏽

If you haven't been on a Twitter Spaces before, a few tips:

-update the Twitter app to ensure access to spaces & reduce glitches

-turn captions on or off from the three-dot menu in top right

-show speakers what you're feeling by clicking on the heart icon & choosing a reaction to flash over your avi

So invite your friends & maybe even your Tory auntie so they can all join us and learn how to be badass activists like YOU!

Looking forward to seeing you there! Let's fight to Kill ALL these Bills!

That's why the government wants to shut it down. They don't want to be challenged or held to account.

🎉But last night they were DEFEATED on 14 amendments 

Here are some:

🔗 Serious disruption prevention orders (ASBOs for activists) - DEFEATED

⭐️People locking themselves on to objects punishable by up to 51 weeks imprisonment ❌ Amendment Rejected 🥳

⭐️Suspicion-less stop-and-search 
❌ Amendment Rejected 🥳

⭐️Introduction of “serious disruption prevention orders” against protesters. 
❌ Amendment Rejected 🥳

⭐️ Giving Police new powers to stop noisy and disruptive protests in England and Wales.
❌ Amendment Rejected 🥳
 
⭐️Obstruction of major transport works 
❌ Amendment Rejected 🥳

⭐️ Interference with use or operation of key national infrastructure” 
❌ Amendment Rejected 🥳

Lords supported the amendment allowing parliament square to continue being a place of protest 🪧✊🏿🪧

There is still much work to do, and we stand in solidarity with the GRT community. We are furious that the facstisitc amendments threatening the traveller way of life remain.

On Saturday January 15th we held our first action of the year and of our plastics campaign, in Lækjartorg. We brought with us a box filled with plastic waste to highlight the Icelandic government's massive shortcomings in waste management.
The statistics released by the Icelandic Reycling Fund are far from real, since they present incinerated plastic as recycled plastic. Nevertheless, even recycling is far from effective, since less than 10% of plastic that has ever been produced, has been recycled. The remainder has been landfilled, burned or is polluting our waterways. 

We have three goals: We want the Icelandic government to assume responsibility and tell the truth about the massive shortcomings in waste management and to disambiguate the effectiveness of recycling. We want the government to stop funding corrupt liars who fail to deliver their promises. We want to hear how everyone wants to deal with this phenomenon, with plastic waste.

Today 800 Lords – of whom less than 10% are from ethnic minorities, around 25% aren't male and the majority are appointed by the Queen – will discuss and vote on the future of British Democracy.⁣
⁣
They will vote on an authoritarian bill that increases stop and search powers, targets the vulnerable, and increases punishments for peaceful protest. The bill is one that has been proposed and amended by the very same cabinet ministers who have lied and broken the laws of this land in front of our very eyes.⁣

Extinction Rebellion stand alongside the many groups and movements that are set to be effected, and stand for all of our right to protest and to challenge a government that are failing to protect us.⁣
⁣
Extinction Rebellion stand for increasing democracy and empowering people to play an active role in policy. Many have questioned the importance or value of Citizens' Assemblies, but today we can think of nothing else, as we watch and wait for a house of unrepresentative unelected public figures to decide on the fate of our democracy and the movements for change.⁣

If you thought the Policing Bill was bad before, that was nothing compared to the latest version.

Priti Patel has quietly added further measures to effectively criminalise protest.

These laws belong in a dictatorship, not a democracy.

Some of the worst new powers 👇🏽

1) Police will be able to stop & search at protests to avoid a ""public nuisance"". If you refuse, you face jail time.

2) Attaching yourself to anything, carrying ""equipment"" for this, even potentially holding hands will be illegal.

3) Most terrifying of all: new Asbo-like orders can be imposed on protesters, even if no crime is committed. These remove rights to freedom of speech and assembly + can ban you from certain places, seeing certain people, carrying certain items, encouraging protest online.*

**(although another ammendments states that you have two protest related convictions you could be banned from using the Internet and communication apps) 🙄 ***

It was through protest that people won some of our most fundamental rights - the right to vote, for example.

No wonder Priti Patel wants to criminalise it.

The people of Venice is going to rise like its waters! 🌊

Hearing the call of the Rebellion, we started a mobilisation project in our beautiful city. Recurrent Heading for Extinction events and campaigns of colorful, daring, nonviolent actions bring the three XR demands to our local government. Going from neighborhood to neighborhood and building on the pre-existing social networks we plan to gather enough people to rebel disruptively for life in Venice this Spring! 

Although we are starting locally, we are also coordinating with other XR groups
in Italy to bring people from all cities to rebel in Rome in October 2022.

To reach our goal we need to cover logistic expenses, so we organised a
crowdfunding and are asking for your support. Your contribution will help
us print banners, flyers and posters, do arts, and help rebels to work full-time on the rebellion.

Follow and support @killthebill_official / LINK IN BIO for toolkit and ways you can help

10th January - the Lords have begun voting on the draconian amendments added to the already authoritarian #PCSCBill.

Now is the time to add your voice by writing letters, holding vigils, posting on social media, ADDING PRESSURE to make sure the amendments are voted down!

Go to ktbofficial.org to access the writing tool. 

What can you actually do about the Police, Courts, Sentencing and Courts Bill? If you’ve read the recent press coverage about the #PolicingBill and want to do something, here is what would actually be useful. 
Action: Write to your MP before 17 Jan.

1. Your letter should start with something like “I am concerned about this Bill because Part 3 will allow almost any protest, gathering, or assembly of people in public to be severely restricted.”

Change the words to your personal tone.

2. Write about a protest or march you attended. It’s useful but not essential to mention how noisy (or not) it was, how busy (or not) it was, how much you knew, why you cared so much, what sorts of campaigning you had tried before that, and what change resulted from the protest.

3. Say that you are very concerned about the new Serious Disruption Prevention Orders (the protest banning orders) which have been reported in the press.

4. End your letter by asking your MP to pass your concerns to members of their party in the House of Lords, and/or to the Minister, Baroness Williams.

Conservatives are in a strong position to pass the letter on to the Minister — if they can be persuaded to do so.

Finally, just to say that when you write to your MP, please be kind. It may make you feel better to shout, but it’s likely to be counterproductive. Remember that MPs are human too!

World’s biggest livestock corporations ‘given free pass by governments’ over lack of clear targets to reduce emissions.

🚨Livestock generate about 32% of anthropogenic, or human-generated, methane, mainly from the planet’s billion-plus cattle. It also accounts for 80-90% of the US’ total water consumption. 

The industrialisation of meat is a deeply colonial story. Industrial farming emerged only in the 1960s, in the US. 

Settler-colonialism and the colonizer’s establishment of corporate capitalism was — and is — the precursor of unethical farming methods.

⁣
When climate protesters risk their liberty to safeguard us all, they deserve thanks not criminal convictions⁣
⁣
Last week, a jury made up of ordinary people agreed⁣
⁣
The jury voted to acquit the six XR protesters who stopped a Docklands Light Railway train at Canary Wharf in April 2019. The six pleaded that their action was a lawful response to imminent climate breakdown and ecological collapse⁣
⁣
The rebels, all members of @christianclimateaction, admitted to their part in the action and its planning, but argued they were within their rights to protest. They reminded the court that the action had been planned to minimise the security risk to the public and themselves, but that attracting media attention is crucial to raise public awareness of the crisis⁣
⁣
#TellTheTruth #Jury #NotGuilty⁣
⁣
During the action on 25th April 2019, five of them climbed on top of the train and displayed banners that read Business As Usual = Death” and “Don’t Jail the Canaries” (in reference to three protesters who were at the time on remand for an earlier protest), while one, Dr Diana Warner, glued herself a train window⁣
⁣
This is one of the first protest cases in the UK to be heard in the crown court following the Supreme Court’s landmark ‘Ziegler’ ruling and could influence the prosecution of future cases. XR has a number of other crown court cases coming up next year that will also be heard before a jury⁣
⁣
Ordinary people understand the difference between ""the law"" & our moral duty to protect Earth. It’s time we all came together in the streets to demand the government #ActNow on the #ClimateEmergency and deliver #ClimateJustice ⁣

⚠️La gran responsabilidad de esto recae en la industria de la moda rápida y las políticas de los gobiernos del mundo que lo permiten. 

🧐ZARA parece haber entendido este problema, una de sus nuevas líneas de ropa llamada “Join Life” (unite a la vida🙄) está hecha con tejidos más sostenibles que sus otras prendas con algo que ellxs denominan “algodón cultivado ecológicamente"", que se fabrica a partir de pulpa de madera (que se afirma que se obtiene de forma sostenible), o tejidos reciclados como el poliéster. 

😒A primera vista, parece un buen esfuerzo y esto es exactamente lo que esta corporación quiere que pensemos 

🤔Resulta que nadie sabe bien el origen y los metodos de producción de estos nuevos tejidos. 

🤷‍♂️¿Acaso esperan que les creamos así no más? 

🔥Necesitamos saber de dónde procede cada tipo de tejido, qué materiales y procesos se emplean en su producción, quién lo fabrica, en qué condiciones trabaja y cuánto se le paga por su trabajo. 

⚖️Sin justicia social en toda la cadena de suministro, estas prendas ""eco-editadas"" no pueden considerarse sostenibles sino un gran lavado verde. 

🛑La moda rápida es un peligro y tiene que ralentizarse: es necesario un cambio de paradigma.

Onze recente acties rond dit thema leverden, naast een heleboel steun, ook onbegrip op. In deze post zetten we daarom ons standpunt nog een keer uiteen en roepen je op te doneren voor de rechtszaak die @kozwartepiet, ook namens onze rebellen, aanspant vanwege de enorme geweldsexplosie in Volendam. En ook om de schade aan de bus te vergoeden (zie onder voor meer informatie over hoe te doneren.) 

Ondanks decennialange uitgesproken kritiek vanuit de Zwarte gemeenschap zijn velen van ons opgegroeid met een sinterklaasfeest, waarbij er geen moment aandacht was voor Zwarte Piet als racistisch figuur. Voor sommige mensen geldt, ook vandaag nog, dat zij moeilijk begrijpen wat Zwarte Piet te maken heeft met de klimaat- en ecologische crisis. 

De klimaat- en ecologische crisis zijn het gevolg van eeuwenlange roofzucht van, met name, Westerse landen. Wij hebben de aarde systematisch leeggeroofd. Fossiele brandstoffen, planten, dieren en mensen: we zien alles op aarde als een manier om onze rijkdom te vergroten. Deze roofzucht beperkt zich niet tot eigen grondgebied. Sterker nog, juist op andermans grondgebied hebben Westerse landen ongekend huisgehouden: kolonialisme. Helaas niet iets van het verre verleden. Dit gebeurt ook vandaag nog, officieel meestal niet meer door staten, maar door multinationals.

Kolonialisme bracht racisme met zich mee. Racisme en slavernij. Dat leidde, uiteindelijk, tot een Zwarte Piet die gebaseerd is op een stereotiepe karikatuur van een Zwart tot slaaf gemaakt persoon. Dat is waarom kolonialisme, racisme en klimaatontwrichting allemaal onderdeel zijn van hetzelfde verrotte systeem. Dat is waarom XR solidair is met KOZP in de strijd tegen anti-zwart racisme en een groep rebellen het VOC-schip bij het Scheepvaartmuseum in Amsterdam heeft bezet en aanwezig was bij de KOZP-demonstratie in Volendam.

Doneren voor de rechtszaak en de schade aan de bus kan online via o.a. iDeal, PayPal, credit card via de link in bio.

Action > Hope > Fear
It has been a scary few weeks and climate anxiety is very real. If you feel overwhelmed and anxious about the climate problem, you are not alone.

When it comes to climate change, fear isn’t enough to motivate long-term, sustained action. It may spur a short-term response; but long-term, it will paralyze us.

What we actually need is efficacy – the understanding that if we act, we can make a difference in ourselves, in others, and in the world around us. And one of the best ways to build efficacy, in ourselves and others, is to look for examples of what other people like us are doing -- and share them --- and do them!

Anche sabato scorso, per il terzo fine settimana consecutivo, migliaia di persone hanno occupato strade, ponti e piazze cittadine a #Belgrado e in molte città della #Serbia. 

✊ Lə manifestanti si battono contro il governo che ha aperto le porte alla multinazionale anglo-australiana #RioTinto, per l’estrazione di #litio in un maxi giacimento nella valle di #Jadar.
Nella valle, che verrebbe devastata e pesantemente inquinata dalle attività estrattive, c’è il più grande granaio del paese e ci sono due fiumi che forniscono acqua a milioni di persone.

🌱 Le proteste, in queste settimane, si sono anche allargate verso altre tematiche ambientali, come l’inquinamento dell’aria (il peggiore in Europa) che uccide migliaia di persone ogni anno.

🙅 La multinazionale ha un passato di corruzione, degrado ambientale e  violazione dei diritti umani, eppure ha già un accordo con il governo serbo per un investimento di 2,4 mld di dollari in quella che diventerebbe la più grande miniera di litio in Europa. Ha inoltre già acquistato l’80% delle case e dei terreni sopra il giacimento, favorita da una legge sulle espropriazioni varata ad hoc dal governo. 
❗La sospensione di questa legge, annunciata qualche giorno fa, è la prima vittoria delle proteste.

👉 Il litio è un materiale necessario per i veicoli elettrici e per lo stoccaggio di energie rinnovabili. 
Questa vicenda ci ricorda che è impensabile sostituire semplicemente le fonti di energia, mantenendo il modello di sviluppo, che, invece, va cambiato profondamente. E ci dimostra ancora che in questo cambiamento epocale la cittadinanza coinvolta in prima linea deve avere voce e potere decisionale.

Michelle Donelan’s office - Chippenham
The Local MP is letting down her constituents and our planet by actively voting against measures to protect our planet.
 
On Saturday 4th December a team of “Dirty Scrubbers” took on the challenge of “cleaning up” the office of the local MP for Chippenham, Michelle Donelan. The event included some theatrics where the scrubbers did some “cleaning” as well as talking to the public, handing out mince pies, with messages and banner drops. The protestors are all part of Extinction Rebellion from Chippenham, Bradford on Avon and other local XR groups.
Protestors argue that COP 26 failed to provide any confidence that the wealthy nations of the Global North, including the UK, are serious about addressing the climate and ecological emergency and they highlight deep concerns about Michelle Donelan’s voting record and support for the current government.
Louise Weissel an environmental activist from Bradford on Avon stated that “The CEE bill will require the UK to achieve climate and nature targets by giving the Secretary of State a duty to implement a strategy to achieve those targets. This bill is now supported by 118 MP’s as it is considered the only way to ensure that decisive, prompt and effective action is taken to support our fragile environment. Yet Michelle Donelan voted against this bill and in doing so, has voted against nature and the environment”
The recent amendment of the Environment Bill to arrest the catastrophic amount of sewage entering our waterways was also voted down by Michelle Donelan.
Mel Moden an Extinction Rebellion Activist from Chippenham said “In 2020 our local water company (Wessex Water) discharged raw sewage from storm overflows for 235,325 hours and this is deemed acceptable by our local MP who voted against measures to prevent this from happening. Once again the environment has come off second best to corporate profit”

🐠 Today we teamed up with @theoceanrebellion to demand that the EU act now to stop industrial overfishing. 

🦐 Over the next two days EU ministers will be ‘negotiating’ next year's EU fishing limits in Brussels behind closed doors.

🐟 XR demands that the EU ministers ignore the interests of Industrial Fishing and listen to the science. The EU must place the marine ecosystem at the heart of its fishing policy by ending overfishing NOW. The EU must ban all Industrial Fishing in EU waters, and all Industrial Fishing by the EU fleet in extra-territorial waters or the waters of other states. Any former subsidies to Industrial fishers must be used to encourage low-impact fishing, by transitional grants to industrial fishing workers and subsidising the artisanal (or traditional small boat) fishing industry.

Anxiety about ecological disasters and threats to the natural environment such as pollution and climate change. 

Variations to the definition exist, to broadly describe the “worry or agitation caused by concerns about the present and future state of the environment”.

The Regen 101 Workshop was created by Christie Wilson in response to the need for XR Working Groups, and the wider community, to understand 

🚨Regenerative Culture as an essential strategy in Extinction Rebellion’s activist project. As a workshop it is experiential,practical and educational and while the booklet is intended as a supportive reference for the
workshop, it is also a valuable, stand-alone resource for Regenerative Culture.

With blockades and occupations in multiple cities in Germany and the Netherlands it's clear that we won't stop until McDonald's and corporations like it take real action. 

Justice can't happen without solidarity and we've seen an upsurge of powerful, disruptive and passionate action as COP26 leaves us with little more than disappointment. We've seen over 120 people arrested resisting against the  unjust imprisonment of nonviolent activists and just last weekend we joined Extinction Rebellion and shut down 13 Amazon fulfilment centres on black Friday, to protest the exploitation of all life.

This fact added to the energy crisis, the rising price of energy and the shortage of products that we are starting to suffer, will go further. 

Given this emergency context, what do our institutions do to protect and care for us? Blablabla! Irresponsibles! 

We must focus on a model of degrowth in which we encourage local trade, free of exploitation and non-polluting, combined with responsible consumption and waste reduction. 

All this means that the only possible way is to put life at the center! Only a sustainable economic and social model that cares for nature and respects the biophysical limits of the planet can secure and protect life!

Berbagai situasi krisis yang diakibatkan oleh krisis iklim memperparah kekerasan berbasis gender. Misalnya, perubahan iklim memengaruhi mata pencaharian masyarakat yang mengandalkan alam, seperti menangkap ikan dan bertani. Ketika mata pencaharian ini terancam, kemiskinan akan semakin parah. Dalam situasi ini, kesenjangan akses terhadap sumber daya dan kuasa pengambilan keputusan dalam keluarga maupun di ranah publik menyebabkan perempuan, anak, dan minoritas gender lebih rentan mengalami kekerasan.

Anak-anak perempuan jadi lebih sering dinikahkan dini, atau bahkan dijual, untuk mengurangi beban ekonomi keluarga. Perempuan bisa saja dipaksa untuk menjadi pekerja seks demi menambah penghasilan. Di sisi lain, para laki-laki yang biasanya menjadi tulang punggung keluarga akan mengalami stres yang tinggi karena kehilangan pekerjaan, sehingga bisa saja melampiaskan frustrasinya dengan melakukan kekerasan terhadap perempuan.

Sementara itu, minoritas gender, yang pada situasi bukan krisis saja amat rentan mengalami diskriminasi dan kekerasan, akan makin terpuruk dalam kondisi krisis. Dalam situasi krisis COVID-19, misalnya, banyak kawan transgender yang kehilangan pekerjaan dan kesulitan mengakses bantuan dari pemerintah karena tidak memiliki KTP. Di masa depan, krisis iklim akan meningkatkan frekuensi terjadinya pandemi, sehingga akan makin sering pula terjadi kekerasan berbasis gender yang menyertainya.

Perjuangan untuk memperlambat krisis iklim tak bisa lepas dari usaha-usaha penghapusan kekerasan berbasis gender. Mari, berontak bersama untuk menuntut keadilan iklim dan keadilan gender!

Andy and Tammy have stopped the first trainload of coal from Adani’s controversial Carmichael mine near Bowen, Queensland this morning.
Tammy and Andy have used steel pipes to lock themselves onto the railway that is carrying Adani's coal.
The police are currently in attendance, with both Omodei and Paine, refusing to leave.
Paine says “Adani will claim that their first shipment of coal is a victory. But it’s certainly not a victory for our climate. That’s why people are going to keep resisting this mine, and any other new fossil fuel projects too.

XR and Animal Rebels are taking action on black Friday to disrupt up to 50 per cent of Amazon's Black Friday deliveries, to make a stand against one of the world’s biggest companies, its exploitative business model and the system it represents. Amazon exploits people, animals and the planet so that the rich can get richer and at the expense of all we hold dear.
Today, Animal Rebellion stands with all of those taking action against Amazon and businesses like it to say loud and clear that a system based on greed and infinite growth will never be what is best for our finite planet or those who live on it.
✊ SHOW YOUR SUPPORT ✊
❄️ COME ON DOWN! It's cold out there and the rebels locked on & hanging from structures need your support! Check out XR’s social media for more details about local sites, get some friends together and we’ll see you soon - bring some food, warm clothes & blankets!
❌ CANCEL YOUR AMAZON PRIME. Consider boycotting this exploitative company which dominates our transactions, if you feel you can afford to. Together, we can send them a message.

Please join us as we take action in solidarity with Wet’suwet’en land defenders who are being unjustly brutalized and arrested on their own lands.

Tomorrow (Friday, November 26th), we will be meeting at Devonian Harbour Park at 7:30 am (at the paved circle near the underpass).

We will then block Lion’s Gate Bridge at peak rush hour traffic. This is the first of many non-violent civil resistance actions over the coming weeks.

Come and show your support!

If you..

- Have no idea what to expect when it comes to the arrest process

- Are concerned about the consequences of arrest

- Want to hear from people just like you who have been arrested as part of non-violent, civil disobedience

DM us! We will connect you with information and resources.

And if you decide to be arrested tomorrow without having done research in advance, no worries! There will be an arrest support team present who can explain the process and answer your questions.

Bottom line, while arrest is your individual choice and responsibility, you don’t have to do it alone.

Join us and send a bold f-u to the systems of harm that are so clearly in operation.

If only we could leave the IMO alone. We would if they took environmental governance seriously. But they don't.

On the cold November morning three Fossil Fool Oil heads, representing industrial lobbying of the IMO, vomited oil and distributed dirty money to arriving delegates on the first day of the latest Marine Environmental Protection Committee (MEPC) meeting.

The IMO is the only international body responsible for the state of the oceans: there is no one else to turn to. Their membership is dominated by the shipping and fishing nations. They are directly and indirectly led by the interests of big oil. They are the UN agency with the most corporate delegates, roughly one third. 

The IMO is not fit for purpose, it cannot protect and conserve ocean environments, especially in an age when we need governance that goes well beyond conservation.

Furthermore shipping is inherently bound up with the interests of the oil industry. Shipping provides the only means for the oil industry to dispose of its waste product. This is burned in big ships’ engines as Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO), the dirtiest form of fuel. If ships didn’t burn it, its disposal would need to be paid for. Instead ships are designed to run on it and subsidised to do so. 

Of all forms of transport, shipping is alone in paying no fuel tax. 80% of ships burn HFO and 40% of what they carry is fuel. Cheap oil makes cheap shipping possible which perpetuates cheap consumption. 95% of all products travel by boat to the UK.

Ocean Rebellion demands the IMO severs all ties with the Fossil Fuel Industry and Acts Now to slash shipping emissions.

In its latest Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC's) to the Paris Agreement, Sri Lanka has decided to bring down its renewable energy target to 70%, from the previous 80%. All while the country's energy authority unions keep pushing for new coal power plants and the government signing new contracts for LNG.

Meanwhile, the statistics used for Sri Lanka's forestry sector NDC dates back to 1996, where the last forest cover assessment was done using LANDSAT imagery. While the latest NDC pledges to increase forest cover from 29% to 32% with continuous deforestation, it's unlikely that the island has 29% forest cover to begin with. This lack of data in the forestry sector makes it difficult for activists to fight against deforestation. 🌳⛏️

The third and most significant issues is the X-Press Pearl disaster, the worst maritime disaster in the history of Sri Lanka. The ship contained 1,486 containers filled with chemicals, including 25 metric tons of nitric acid and 78 metric tons of nurdles (plastic pellets). This disaster has damaged our marine ecosystem, livelihoods of fishing communities, and its long-term impacts threaten the entire Indian Ocean. 🌊🐳💀

Even with tireless volunteer efforts to cleanup in the aftermath, most of the nurdles and toxic chemicals still remain. We also lack the local and international maritime laws to prevent such spills. Neither do we have transparency and accountability, with organizations like International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation (ITOPF) attempting to downplay the damage. So, we urge global leaders to strengthen international maritime laws, to prevent disasters like this from happening in the future. 🗣️

Show your support by sharing this video and tagging global leaders to strengthen international environmental and maritime laws to protect most affected countries. 🌎

COP26 sudah berakhir dan hasilnya tidak lebih dari pengecewaan masal, dimana para pemimpin dunia secara sadar mengirim jutaan orang ke kematian dini.

Climate Action Tracker telah mengkaji dari semua pembicaraan dan janji para negara, dunia tetap akan menuju ke pemanasan global di 2.4 derajat diatas suhu rata rata pra industri. Indonesia sendiri adalah salah satu negara dengan komitmen terburuk, dikaji setara dengan pemanasan 3-4 derajat jika seluruh dunia melakukan yang sama dengan Indonesia. 

Sekarang, di 1.2 derajat saja sudah ada 7.2jt masyarakat Indonesia yang harus menderita dan mengungsi di tahun 2021. Dengan berita bencana yang seakan akan datang setiap harinya di penjuru tanah air. Sampai separah apakah sebelum situasinya bisa berubah? 

Sayangnya para pemangku kebijakan seakan buta terhadap realita, masih banyak membicarakan investasi dan ekonomi yang ektraktif yang justru malah memperburuk situasi. Seakan buta akan realita, masih belum ada sikap tegas dari tingkat tertinggi negara untuk menyatakan bahwa ya kita sedang berada di keadaan darurat iklim, dan semua lapisan masyarakat harus bergerak bersama memutarbalikan situasi.

Tapi masih ada harapan. Suara rakyat adalah suara Tuhan, dan kebijakan publik pada akhirnya akan mengikuti opini publik. Mari jadi bagian dari dorongan opini publik dengan melakukan aksi langsung tanpa kekerasan di tempatmu masing masing, dimanapun kita berada, agar para pemangku kebijakan tidak bisa abai lagi terhadap kenyataan dan sains yang ada.

Mari kita semua bersuara demi kehidupan kita semua.

Mari kita berontak demi kehidupan.

According to Climate Action Tracker, commitments so far still mean we face a catastrophic 2.4C global heating by the end of the century.

COP26’s failure points to the need for a radical change of gear, a shift into emergency mode where all the world’s resources are directed at the climate crisis, and fossil fuels are phased out, not invited in.

Ben Carey, from Climate Call-Up, said: “This COP packed with fossil fuel lobbyists should be a wake-up call to citizens everywhere, especially those who have trusted politicians to deliver. The Climate Siren dramatises the dire peril we are in. We all need to radically step up pressure on governments. If we don’t, we’ll be hearing much louder and more regular sirens in our future, as the climate crisis hits humanity with full force.”

A better world is possible. 🌍💚

Just four days after landmark climate talks in Scotland in which Joe Biden vowed the US will “lead by example” in tackling dangerous global heating, the president’s own administration is providing a jarring contradiction – the largest ever sale of oil and gas drilling leases in the Gulf of Mexico.

The enormous size of the lease sale – covering an area that is twice as large as Florida – is a blunt repudiation of Biden’s previous promise to shut down new drilling on public lands and waters. It has stunned environmentalists who argue the auction punctures the US’s shaky credibility on the climate crisis and will make it harder to avert catastrophic impacts from soaring global heating.

Experts have said that the development of new oil and gas fields must stop this year if the world is to avoid more disastrous heatwaves, floods and other climate impacts, with fossil fuel production on America’s public lands causing around a quarter of the country’s overall greenhouse gas pollution.
However, the oil and gas industries immediately objected to Biden’s move, claiming it imperiled jobs and risked pushing up energy prices, and a dozen states sued to lift the moratorium. In June, a federal judge in Louisiana agreed with the states and found that the government hadn’t taken the required steps to pause new leases. This courtroom setback has forced the Gulf of Mexico sale, according to the Biden administration.

Interior estimates that the 80+ million acre megasale will lead to the production of up to 1.12 billion barrels of oil, 4.42 trillion feet of gas. Burning this amount of oil and gas would result in more than 516 million metric tons of greenhouse gases, equivalent to 112 million cars, 130 coal-fired power plants operating for a year, or the carbon sequestered by 632 million acres of forests.

We're here to give you the latest news from the UN climate summit.

Today we are excited to share the updated list of fossil fuel projects cancelled during COP26. We can't wait to congratulate world leaders on their ambition.

By region, the total fossil fuel projects cancelled, during COP26:

THE EU CANCELLED: 0
THE US CANCELLED: 0
THE UK CANCELLED: 0
AUSTRALIA CANCELLED: 0
INDIA CANCELLED: 0
CHINA CANCELLED: 0
RUSSIA CANCELLED: 0
BRAZIL CANCELLED: 0
THE REST OF THE WORLD CANCELLED: 0

Today across the world they will announce the task ahead is difficult, but 1.5 degrees is still in reach. Some NGO's will even agree with them. But given the UK Government has failed to meet most of it's pledges on climate in the last 10 years, will they even meet these woefully inadequate climate targets anyway. 

Are they in denial, delusional, or deceiving us. To claim to believe we can keep global average temperature within just an extra 0.3C of warming without cancelling new and expanding fossil fuel projects is just lies. Since 2001 we've had a rise of 0.7C, and in 2021 we have 20% MORE fossil fuel infrastructure than 2001. Yet any attempt to make firm plans to stop funding fossil fuels have been lost from this process.

Two weeks ago world leaders were criticized for throwing coins in a wishing well.

Today as world leaders celebrate signing the death warrant of millions, we are required to do more than critique. It's time for mass civil resistance.

Today, on the last day of African ECOCIDE week, XR Cape Town staged a multiple “die-ins” at the various African Energy Week venues @vandawaterfront , with several protesters playing dead to raise awareness of the millions of deaths that will be caused by anthropogenic global warming should governments fail to put a halt to the burning of fossil fuels, which are one of the main drivers of the climate crisis. The African Energy Week’s programme and participants are key drivers of fossil fuel developments in Africa.

탄소중립위원장 윤순진은 ""COP26에 와 보니 한국이 제조업 비중이 높고 탄소배출 정점을 찍은 지 얼마 지나지 않은 사정을 감안할 때 이번 목표가 도전적이란 점을 인식하며 환영하는 분위기가 있다""고 말했다.

-----

몇십년 넘게 목표 계획만 외치고 있는 한국 및 부유국의 지배자들👺
심지어 그 목표마저 세계 온실가스 배출 7위 국가로서 처참한 수준입니다.💩

온실가스 감축 목표에는 들어가지도 않는 포스코,SK등 대기업이 세계의 바다와 땅에서 시추하고 투자하는 화석연료 
🛢🏗

엄청난 밀도의 공장식 축산업에서 매년 발생하는 구제역과 AI,이어지는 대규모 살처분을 생각해보세요. 
☠️🦠

결국 이 모든 위기와 이어진 코로나로 인해 평범한 사람들의 삶은 무너졌지만, 코로나 호황으로 온실가스 다배출 기업들의 주가는 고공행진 중 입니다.
📈

-----
👹
기후생태위기의 비상사태에 대응하지않는 주요 원인은 필요한 조치를 취하려는 정치적 의지가 없다는 것입니다. 

☠️
지배자들은 기후위기를 부정하는 전략에서 좋은 말을 늘어놓으며 실질적 조치를 지연시키는 전략으로 전환하고 있습니다.

📣
""올바른 말을 하는 것""은 매우 쉽지만, 이러한 단어를 필요한 실질적 조치로 행하는 것은 훨씬 어렵습니다.

🏭🤵🏻‍♂️
지금의 현상을 유지해야 이익을 얻는 이들의 엄청난 반대와,
그들과 유착되어 있거나 초라한 임시조치만 취한 채 책임을 회피하는 정치인.

🫀🎳
이들이 우리의 목숨을 건 게임을 하고 있는 것이 지금의 현실입니다.
우리가 그들을 자리에서 내려오게 하지 않으면, 변화는 불가능합니다. 

🏃🏽‍♀️🏃🏻‍♂️🌎
기후운동은 COP26 뒤에 많은 사람들과 더 크고 더 단단히 성장해야합니다. 이 글을 읽고 있는 바로 당신과, 한사람 한 사람이 절실히 필요합니다. 

⏳⌛️
멸종반란은 원칙에 동의하는 누구나 허락없이 조직하고 시작할 수 있으며, 여러그룹의 소규모 불복종행동은 효과적으로 사람들의 각성을 이끌어낼 수 있습니다. 

⛓🔒🪜
시간이 많이 남지 않았습니다. 목소리가 모이지 못하게 우리를 가두던 정치 방역이 조금이나마 누그러진 지금, 파업, 도로 점거, 봉쇄 및 창의적인 불복종 행동을 시작할 때입니다!

On Monday @XR_Vic's Mornington Peninsula local group held a demonstration outside the office of Greg Hunt, as part of ongoing actions shedding light on failing #COP26 climate talks in Glasgow.

Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt has said he bases his management of COVID-19 on the science provided by experts.

XR Mornington Peninsula demand that MP Hunt apply the same logic & protect the health of Australia’s children, and all future generations, from the climate crisis.

“Hunt can no longer ignore his duty of care to represent the worried families on the Mornington Peninsula who fear for their children’s future! I fear what the world will look like for my kids if countries like Australia continue to do nothing!"" said rebel Vanessa

Rebels staged a parade of prams followed by speeches and a die-in. During the die-in Scomo chucked another planet on the barbie.

This morning @xrvic_aus rebels held a funeral march for a four-metre tall burning koala, Blinky. This spectacular & disturbing creature, is part distressed koala, part skeleton. As you can see, they are emitting smoke, and is loudly crying in pain

Blinky “represents the terror our animals are facing in the climate emergency,” Billions of native animals, including roughly 60,000 koalas, were killed, injured or displaced by catastrophic bushfires in 2019/2020

An estimated 200,000 people took to the streets of Glasgow y’day and over 300 actions happened all over the world to hold global leaders and corporations to account and demand climate justice now🗯. 

✊This beautiful day of solidarity was a symbol of what can happen if we stand together to fight for our collective future - platforming the voices of the people most impacted by the climate crisis. 

💚Do not give up hope! This fight moves beyond COP, hundred of thousands of people have said yes to system change and yes to a sustainable future where we can ALL thrive! 

📢Now we must make decisions makers LISTEN and take bold action to keep 1.5°C alive! Get involved ⚡️.

An ambulance was let pass through, but not the world leaders, who wanted to reach the G20 summit to decide behind us, and behind the other 188 countries of the world.

The police intervened to remove the activist, subsequently agents in riot gear surrounded the demonstrators.

However, in the afternoon the city of Rome was crossed by a procession of thousands of people entitled ""you G20, we the future""

The governments of the G20 have failed to defend the citizens of the world from the climate and ecological crisis, staining themselves with crimes against humanity because of their negligence and their action in favor of the destruction of ecosystems.

We were here to unite with those who will demonstrate from 2 November in Glasgow for the COP26, where the same heads of state present in Rome will risk concluding the summit with the same postponement, made up of non-binding promises and agreements empty of commitments and solutions.

To the G20 we say: from Rome to Glasgow, your solutions are the problem!

Our partners in Goma, DRC are planning many actions and mobilizations over the COP period, we are determined to make sure their voices are heard through both social media and actions in Glasgow. Here are the words from Goma about their action yesterday!

“Once again with the people of Goma, we ask for payment of carbon credits by polluting countries to the less polluting countries, the banning of the fossil industry across the planet and any project aimed at damaging our motherland. All this for a better world.

let's wait for Cop26 to take these reasonable responsibilities cited above.

An appeal is made to all Congolese citizens to join us this 09/10 to continue and strengthen this rich and noble fight.

When we unite it will hurt.”

Solidarity with Virunga and everyone in the DRC, remember you can still donate to this group via the link in our bio!

🌳 Well done rebels! What a day. Over a thousand rebels were out on the streets protesting against false climate solutions! 

Greenwashing March 
💀 Over 1000 rallied at Buchanan Street steps with banners, samba drumming, and large props including a giant skeleton puppet

❤️ Dirty Scrubbers, Red Rebels, and Blue Rebels all performed during the march

⛽️ Half of the march went to George Square, where there were speeches and an ""oil spill"" performance

👩🏼‍🎨 The other half went to SSE on Waterloo Street, where four we arrested for locking-on, blocking the entrance, and spraying chalk paint at the building

🏦 The march also protested outside JP Morgan on Waterloo Place and Lloyds on St Vincent Street

👮‍♀️ The police kettled 500 marchers on St Vincent Street for two hours

🦚 The kettled march was taken to the COP26 venue, and then allowed to disperse

****

🛢️ Stop Cambo - Turn off Tap 

Stop Cambo held an action on Buchananan steps in Glasgow to commemorate the anniversary of the first North Sea oil pipeline being turned on by the Queen in 1975. 

👑 In a mock ceremony ‘the Queen’ turning off the taps

🕺 Divest Discobedience

Glasgow was treated to some Divest Discobedience courtesy of Divest Strathclyde with BP or not BP, Fridays for Future and Money Money Money, and speakers including local councillors and 350.org founder Bill McKibben.

With dances, songs and speeches the event called for Divest Discobedience:

With dance and songs and speeches to those gathered, speakers focussed on the £836 million Strathclyde Pension Fund – one of the largest Local Authority pension funds in the UK - has invested in fossil fuels to date.

Alors que s’ouvre à #Glasgow la #COP26, des militant·e·s d’#ExtinctionRebellion ont pris place hier dans le centre commercial des Halles à Paris pour alerter sur le futur apocalyptique qui nous attend, et dénoncer l’inaction des gouvernements 😒

🗣 Depuis plus de 50 ans, les scientifiques dénoncent le lien entre réchauffement climatique et activité humaine, et appelent les Etats à réduire les émissions de gaz à effet de serre. 
Depuis 25 ans, les COP successives ont échoué à imposer les mesures suffisantes aux gouvernements. Les engagements pris ne sont pas à la hauteur et ne sont pas respectés. Partout, les émissions de gaz à effet de serre ne cessent d’augmenter. 
Alors qu’ils sont parfaitement conscients des conséquences, les gouvernements et les banques continuent d’investir massivement dans les énergies fossiles. Ils préfèrent les intérêts privés des entreprises à la sauvegarde du vivant.
 
Des scientifiques, des représentants d'Attac France , d'Alternatiba, de Greenpeace France dont son président Jean-François Julliard, ainsi que l’activiste Camille Etienne ont pris la parole pour alerter sur les conséquences dramatiques du réchauffement, et exprimer leur colère face à l’irreponsabilité de nos dirigeant·e·s.

🧟 Des zombies symbolisant les catastrophes qui nous menacent - effondrement de la biodiversité, inondations, sécheresses, montée des eaux, mégafeux, famines, guerres - ont envahi l’espace public.

⚫️ Après un die-in sanglant, les #BlackRebels ont fait leur apparition pour la première fois en France. Des équipes se sont dispersées pour afficher des messages autour du centre commercial tandis que zombies et militant·e·s ont initié une marche pour le climat. 

📆 Rendez-vous le 6 novembre pour une mobilisation commune à #Paris !

Rebel Larissa Payne has scaled a four metre ladder, locked on, and blocked the road to the Sydney Opera House on unceded Gadigal land to protest the catastrophic failure of @ScottMorrisonMP and world leaders. ⁣

“Capitalism is killing the biosphere. We must abandon the death cult of neoliberal economics to survive. We can’t have infinite growth on a finite planet,” says @Lala_Dolce_Vita, XR organiser, high school teacher and journalism master’s student. ⁣
⁣
“We need systems change, not climate change. The colonial-capitalist system has caused the climate crisis and upholds it. Scientists leaked part of the IPCC Report which is explicit when it says civilisation will not survive a heating planet if we don’t abandon the capitalist model.”⁣
 ⁣
“We need to make sweeping changes to the nature of economy and the way we share our planet. We must listen to the voices of global Indigenous and tribal communities who care for 80 per cent of the planet’s biodiversity. We must listen to those already affected like the #TorresStrait8 and those who will be disproportionately affected in future. We must #DecoloniseToSurvive.”⁣
⁣
“Let’s reimagine and rebuild a society that is equitable and sustainable, where no one is left behind! Together we can do it! The clean tech and answers to #ClimateJustice exist!”⁣
⁣
“Murray Bookchin said, ‘The assumption that what currently exists must necessarily exist is the acid that corrodes all visionary thinking.’ F*ck that acid! It does NOT have to be this way!”⁣
⁣
“WE have the visionary thinking that so-called leaders lack! Humanity — the 99%— is the hope. We are the hope! But we must #RebelForLife.”⁣

Extinction Rebellion COP will :

🌈 Give climate change a human face 🌈
We will bring 3 rebels from the Global South - from Argentina, Tunisia, and Brazil to attend COP26 in person. Here they will be able to tell their stories directly to the world's media. Listening to the truth directly from those in jeopardy will give new emotional urgency to their realities and create empathy for our shared future and the desire for justice.

🌍 Let the world know what's really happening (and NOT happening) at the conference 🌍
We will create an efficient media hub in a venue close to the conference centre - this will facilitate integrating multi-camera reporting through livestreams, interviews and recordings in Glasgow, the COP26 conference and internationally

👓 Make it easy for the world to understand the difference between symbolic change and real change 👓
We will live stream to XR hubs and social media globally...to amplify the voices and stories of the very real humans on the climate frontlines...and in turn, allow them to see and hear first-hand the politics, the watered-down truth, and greenwashing that is likely to be on show from international governments at COP26.

We shut down two major highways in Manhattan. Students, social workers, grandmothers, engineers, mamas, teachers, and friends. We stepped out into busy highways and asked people to be patient with us as we shouted about the planet dying. About how afraid we are of losing each other, our futures, our favorite places. About all of the people, beings, and treasures we have already lost and the injustice of a system that protects those who have done the most damage and punishes those who have contributed the least. I’m terrified of the future we’re heading into.

We’ve tried everything else from petitions, phone banking, marches; begging our politicians to do literally anything. And now, one of our last chances to do the bare minimum is slipping by as the Build Back Better Act continues to be threatened by politicians held in comfort by the fossil fuel industry. All of this before COP26, a major climate conference that produced the Paris Climate Accords six years ago (which were again, a major failure that no country actually stuck to). We need climate action now, for all of us. 

I’m from Wyoming, a major fossil fuel producing state that I absolutely adore and love and I’m worried about losing. I’m also worried about all of those families and individuals who I know that rely on fossil fuels to survive, I love you and hear you and want you all to know that a just transition off of fossil fuels is 100% possible and while it may feel like a sacrifice, so to are the millions of people and other living relatives that we stand to lose by continuing to produce harmful products that are destroying our collective home. We can move through this together but time is running out and we have to act now. Our press release has more information linked in it if you’re interested! #climateactionnow

The land surrounding Ada'itsx (Fairy Creek) is on Unceded Pacheedaht and Ditidaht Territory and actually the majority of ""British Columbia"" is on unceded land which means the land was never surrendered, never signed over in a treaty and never won in a battle - simply occupied and taken.

A string of protests against old-growth logging in western Canada have become the biggest act of civil disobedience in the country’s history, with the arrest of least 1126 people to date. They have also exposed both the legacy of old growth logging in a vulnerable ecosystem and the complex politics of the region.

Sovereign land is land that has not been incorporated into the colonial world, land that is not owned and not under the “dominion“ of settler colonialism. In short sovereign land is indigenous land.

Old growth forests are among the last sovereign lands on Vancouver Island, and their annihilation is just a continuation of the colonial genocide that has taken place against indigenous peoples since occupation began in 1492. @xr_vancouver and @fairycreekblockade and other amazing groups are working closely in alliance with the land defenders at Ada'itsx and old growth protection groups around Vancouver Island.

This morning, as a culmination of the week of rebellion, we have occupied the street of Gran Via in front of Plaza de España to demand the government take climate action now.
We need courageous measures at the next Climate Summit in Glasgow and that the necessary agreements are reached and that it is the definitive one.
WE DON'T WANT ANOTHER SUMMIT NEXT YEAR: WE ARE LATE!
We have been around 150 people coming from local groups from all over the territory. Nine rebels blocked the road and were finally arrested. We assume the consequences because we have no other choice. The real problem is not citizens disobeying, but the criminal inaction of governments that leads us to nonviolent civil disobedience.
IMMEDIATE AND RADICAL ACTION
NO MORE WASTING TIME AT CLIMATE SUMMITS
REBELLION OR EXTINCTION

AHORA O NUNCA: ANTE LA INACCIÓN, REBELIÓN

Esta mañana, como colofón a la semana de rebelión hemos ocupado la calle de Gran Vía frente a Plaza de España para exigir al gobierno que tomen acción climática YA.

Necesitamos medidas valientes en la próxima Cumbre del Clima en Glasgow y que se llegue a los acuerdos necesarios y que sea la definitiva.

NO QUEREMOS OTRA CUMBRE EL AÑO QUE VIENE: VAMOS TARDE

Hemos sido alrededor de 150 personas venidas de grupos locales de todo el territorio. 9 rebeldes se han bloqueado y finalmente han sido detenidas. Asumimos las consecuencias porque no tenemos otra opción. El verdadero problema no son ciudadanos desobedeciendo, sino la criminal inacción de los gobiernos que nos lleva a la desobediencia civil noviolenta.

(LINK IN BIO for our sources and facts)

First, where did this come from? Well, there’s a long, racist tradition of invoking the threat of China as a scapegoat/excuse for everything powerful people do or don’t want to do. China is the world’s excuse for cruelty and barbarism. If we don’t behave atrociously, politicians and columnists assure us, China will, so we had better do it first, before we are outcompeted.

China Syndrome is the 21st century extension of the Yellow Peril myth. First formulated by Kaiser Wilhelm II, whose extreme militarism, racism and anti-Semitism prefigured the rise of Nazism in Germany, the term reflects a long-standing apprehension about the people of Asia.

It is, of course, true that China contributes substantially to the threat of climate breakdown: it is now the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases. So pointing at China, even when its per capita emissions were much smaller than the UK, came naturally to racists and deniers.

The paternalistic assumption that only the rich nations can afford to care is also based on a myth: a myth that dates back to the colonial era. The Greendex survey of consumer attitudes shows that people in developing countries tend to feel much guiltier about their impacts on the natural world than people in developed countries, even though those impacts might be far smaller. Of the nations surveyed, the people of Germany, the US, Australia and Britain felt the least consumer guilt; while the people of India, China, Mexico and Brazil felt the most. The more we consume, the less we feel. There is no scope for moral superiority in the climate talks, least of all a moral superiority based on unfounded national stereotypes.

So don’t forget that “Yeah, but China” is just an excuse. An excuse fuelled by a lethal combination of historic racism and current selfishness. China’s emissions certainly need to be reduced. But a failure by China to take sufficient action neither cancels nor excuses inaction over here.

FRIDAY

Friday was an intense day. First we walked in a solidarity march past several embassies and showed our support for people and communities who are taking the biggest hit in the climate and ecological crisis.🌏

There were no less than three blockades. In front of the NOPEGA lobby building, on the Bezuidenhoutseweg near the Social and Economic Council (SER) and at the Parliament.

At the end of our peaceful blockade in front of the Parliament, the police again acted very violently. The police are proving once again to stand for a toxic and violent system, the same system that threatens life on Earth....

It was a day full of emotions and it is moments like these when we can come together as a movement and show our resilience🔥💚

A huge thank you to everyone who showed up in the rain, to the indigenous elders & speakers who shared their wisdom & lessons with us to move forward in the right way, to David Suzuki for coming to support and to all who sat down on the road today to show we will not watch by as our government pushes towards extinction.

Tomorrow we hit the streets again! Gather 12pm at Grandview Park before we take to Commercial Broadway to Stop the Trans Mountain Pipeline!

Join the Canada wide rebellion today! We can end Old Growth Logging, we can end fossil fuel subsidies, we can end empty words and greenwashing that have no basis of action behind them. 

Find your local group at rebellion.global/groups and join the rebellion from the 16th of October to the 29th of October! 

The UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) is coming up and the pressure is on all governments to take meaningful climate action.

With a big civil disobedience campaign that results in a large number of arrests and national public attention on the demand to end all fossil fuel subsidies we can make sure Trudeau and the government know that this is the step they must take.

Join us from 16-29 October.

All  major oil companies were inside.  Particular targets for protest were ReconAfrica, with drilling rights in the Okavango Delta, Total and CNOOC (China) responsible for  the 1,445 km heated East Africa Crude Oil Pipeline,  and the possibility of talke inside where drilling rights could be granted in Virunga National Park, DRC

As the International Energy Agency states:
- There should be no new oil and gas projects
- We must invest in clean energy to create millions of new jobs, universal access to electirity and clean cooking worldwide.
- This decade annual spending on clean energy in developing economies must expand more than seven times to $1 trillion

East Africa Crude Oil Pipeline is being constructed by French Total and Chinese CNOOC - it is the world's longest heated oil pipeline - 1445 kms from Uganda to Tanzania.  It is threatening critical ecosystems, large scale displacements and risking water and wetlands that tens of millions of people rely on.

RecoAfrica has oil exploration rights across 35,000 squ km in Namibia and Botswana.  The alleged oil discoveries if burnt would amount to one sixth the world's remaining carbon budget.  It lies in the watershed of pristine Okavango Delta, home to the largest remaining wildlife populations in Africa and the livelihoods of a million people that rely on its waters. 

Virunga National Park is home to forillas and immense biodiversity, but DRC has recently made oil extraction in protected areas such as Virunga legal, opening the way to catastrophic environmental damage and threatening the water sources of 3 million people.

🌈 Give climate change a human face 🌈
We will bring 6 - 8 rebels from the Global South to attend COP26 in person. Here they will be able to tell their stories directly to the world's media. Listening to the truth directly from those in jeopardy will give new emotional urgency to their realities and create empathy for our shared future and the desire for justice.

🌍 Let the world know what's really happening (and NOT happening) at the conference 🌍
We will create an efficient media hub in a venue close to the conference centre - this will facilitate integrating multi-camera reporting through livestreams, interviews and recordings in Glasgow, the COP26 conference and internationally

👓 Make it easy for the world to understand the difference between symbolic change and real change 👓
We will live stream to XR hubs and social media globally...to amplify the voices and stories of the very real humans on the climate frontlines...and in turn, allow them to see and hear first-hand the politics, the watered-down truth, and greenwashing that is likely to be on show from international governments at COP26.

October 12th, 2021 by Extinction Rebellion Affinity Youth Network -

3 youth activists chalk spray and hang placards on the Belgrave Square statue of Christopher Columbus in solidarity with Indigenous Resistance Day protestors across the world. 

They livestreamed themselves holding banners and setting off flares to highlight the continued neocolonial violence that Abya Yala, the so-called Americas, is subject to and has been since the invasion initiated by Columbus and to demand the statue be removed.

Christopher Columbus is still revered as an “adventurer” who “discovered” the so-called Americas, named by communities of resistance as Abya Yala, the Indigenous name in the Kuna language (1). However, in truth, Christopher Columbus was so brutal and genocidal that at one point the Spanish Crown itself ordered his imprisonment and stripped him of his rank (2). continued in comments",NA,NA,NA,2.21

Alors que nos rebelles infiltraient le défilé #LouisVuitton, une trentaine d’activistes des @amisdelaterrefr @youthforclimateparis et d’@extinctionrebellionfrance ont realisé un défilé devant la pyramide du Louvre pour attirer l'attention des passant.e.s sur les ravages de la mode et sur la connivence entre LVHM et le gouvernement !

Le Gouvernement a, à l’heure actuelle, l’opportunité d’adopter une réglementation ambitieuse pour le secteur et il n’en fait rien :

☑️ Il refuse de limiter la surproduction (refuse le plafonnement sur les mises en marché ou la limitation du nombre de collections dans la réforme de la filière à responsabilité élargie des producteurs).

☑️ Il refuse d’encadrer la publicité sur le textile (a refusé l’interdiction des publicités sur les produits polluants dans la loi Climat, a refusé les mentions légales sur la publicité textile dans la Loi économie circulaire).

☑️ Il refuse d’inclure le textile dans la taxe carbone aux frontières en négociation à l’Union européenne, ou les standards environnementaux et sociaux minimaux sur les produits.

☑️ Il a permis que l’ensemble des produits neufs invendus puissent être recyclés (donc broyés) pour protéger le secteur du luxe qui ne voulait pas être obligé de solder ou donner ses invendus.

☑️ Il mise tout sur le recyclage des textiles qui ne permet pas de réduire les émissions de gaz à effet de serre.

🚫♻️ Le Fashion Pact porté par Emmanuel Macron et Kering est ainsi une opération de Greenwashing et non le début d’un vrai changement dans le secteur. 

Face à ces clowns du climat, passons à l’action : refusons, réduisons, réparons, réutilisons, recyclons ! 

Et surtout, rebellons-nous ✊

This is the story leading up to COP26. It is a tale of greed, injustice, failure and cruelty by world governments and their corporate partners. After 25 COP meetings, carbon emissions are still rising. The ever-worsening Climate and Ecological Emergency is a Crime Against Humanity perpetrated by the rich and powerful against the poor and vulnerable.

We charge the world’s most powerful governments with mass manslaughter by gross negligence. Their duty is to protect us and they are failing.

Since the 3rd of October, rebels from all over Switzerland take their chair and plant and sit on the streets of Zürich. The activists will keep on blocking the streets of the biggest Swiss city until the Swiss government shows an adequate response to the three demands: Tell the truth, net zero by 2025 and citizens assemblies. An open letter has been handed over to the federal council in June and an ultimatum has been put. This is why we will return back to blocking the streets - every day at noon!

AMPLIFY THE GLOBAL SOUTH.

In Glasgow, with your financial support 👉 link in bio, Extinction Rebellion COP will :

🌈 Give climate change a human face 🌈
We will bring 6 - 8 rebels from the Global South to attend COP26 in person. Here they will be able to tell their stories directly to the world's media. Listening to the truth directly from those in jeopardy will give new emotional urgency to their realities and create empathy for our shared future and the desire for justice.

🌍 Let the world know what's really happening (and NOT happening) at the conference 🌍
We will create an efficient media hub in a venue close to the conference centre - this will facilitate integrating multi-camera reporting through livestreams, interviews and recordings in Glasgow, the COP26 conference and internationally

👓 Make it easy for the world to understand the difference between symbolic change and real change 👓
We will live stream to XR hubs and social media globally...to amplify the voices and stories of the very real humans on the climate frontlines...and in turn, allow them to see and hear first-hand the politics, the watered-down truth, and greenwashing that is likely to be on show from international governments at COP26.

⁣
On Saturday, Extinction Rebellion activists blocked all major entrances to Farnborough Airport, calling on the world's super-rich elite and governments to ditch private flights.⁣
⁣
Farnborough caters to the 1% by exclusively providing services for business and private aircraft. Private jet flyers are responsible for half of aviation’s global emissions. ⁣
⁣
The climate and ecological emergency is happening now, it will affect everyone, but it is not being caused by everyone. We know the most wealthy emit many more tons of carbon than any other group. In an emergency private jets should simply not be an option, but instead it's the only growing aviation sector since the start of the pandemic.⁣
⁣
Climate Assembly UK, a citizens' assembly commissioned by Parliament in 2019, proposed a ban on private jets. Their recommendations have been ignored by our government. ⁣
⁣
In an emergency, when the government refuses to listen to the people, the people need to take action. We demand the Government listen to the people and empower citizens assemblies to decide the policy we need to tackle this crisis. ⁣
⁣
#CitizensAssembliesNow #ClimateEmergency #ActNow #RebelForLife ⁣

Disabled rebel James Brown is currently serving 12 months for disrupting London City Airport, another airport catering to business and private fliers, in 2019. Join him and others taking direct action to tackle the biggest emitters in a climate emergency. ⁣

All of these companies are BACKING GROUPS FIGHTING A LANDMARK CLIMATE BILL. 

Some of America’s most prominent companies, including Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Disney, are backing business groups that are fighting landmark climate legislation, despite their own promises to combat the climate crisis, a new analysis has found. But these leading companies, and others, either support or actively steer the very lobby groups that are attempting to sink the bill that carries the weight of Joe Biden’s ambitions to tackle the climate crisis, threatening one of the last major legislative efforts that will help decide whether parts of the world plunge into a new, barely livable climatic state.

“Major corporations love to tell us how committed they are to addressing the climate crisis and building a sustainable future, but behind closed doors, they are funding the very industry trade groups that are fighting tooth and nail to stop the biggest climate change bill ever,” said Kyle Herrig, president of watchdog group Accountable.US, which compiled the analysis.

None of the companies contacted by the Guardian would rebuke the stance of the lobby groups they are part of and none said they would review their links to these groups.

Anche i pompieri hanno raggiunto il luogo dell'azione.

In tutto questo, la preCOP continua a porte chiuse, decidendo del nostro futuro mentre i governi si tappano le orecchie per ignorare le voci di chi è qua fuori.

THE TIME TO ACT IS NOW. 

Traditional strategies like petitioning, lobbying, voting and protest have not worked due to the rooted interests of political and economic forces. Our approach is therefore one of non-violent, disruptive civil disobedience – a rebellion to bring about change, since all other means have failed.

Onze muze? H&M. 

H&M hoopt mee te liften op de 'duurzaamheidsgolf' met zijn 'Conscious Collection', maar de praktijken van het merk zijn verre van bewust. 96% van de collectie bleek niet te voldoen aan de beloofde duurzaamheidsdoelstellingen. Het recente gebruik van jonge activisten voor hun campagnes laat bovendien zien dat H&M niet gaat voor een echte toewijding aan duurzaamheid, maar eerder voor een aantrekkelijk verpakte misleiding.

Dus hebben we het script omgedraaid♻️

6 rebellen werden ""groen gewassen"" terwijl ze slechts een paar van de praktijken vertoonden die doorgaans met fast-fashion worden geassocieerd. 

Met onze actie roepen we de H&M-groep op om haar praktijken in overeenstemming te brengen met wat het beeld wat ze uitdraagt, want onthoud: er is geen mode op een dode planeet.🌍🌏

--- e n g l i s h 

🍃You are looking at our Great Greenwashing Show. 🍃

Our muse? H&M. 

H&M hopes to ride the ‘sustainability’ wave with its ‘Conscious Collection’’, but the brand’s practices are far from conscious. 96% of the collection was found to not live up to its promised sustainability targets. The recent instrumentalization of young activists for their campaigns furthermore shows that H&M isn’t going for a true commitment to sustainability, but rather just a performative deception. 

So we flipped the script♻️

6 rebels were ""washed green"" while showcasing just a few of the practices that are commonly associated with the fast-fashion industry. 

With our action we call upon H&M group to align its practices with what they preach, because remember; there is no fashion on a dead planet.🌍🌏

We are in the midst of a climate and ecological breakdown. We are facing an uncertain future - our world is in crisis and life itself is under threat. Now is not the time to ignore the issues; now is the time to act as if the truth is real. The science is clear. We are in the midst of a mass extinction of our own making and our governments are not doing enough to protect their citizens, our resources, our biodiversity, our planet, and our future.
This crisis knows no borders, race or ethnicity, and while wealth may offer some protection, it is all but temporary. The clock is ticking, and if we don’t succeed in uniting to protect our planet, everyone will be impacted - you, your family, everyone and everything you hold dear…
…and yet every crisis contains the possibility of transformation.

“WE” DID NOT CAUSE THE CLIMATE CRISIS 

WE ARE THE GLOBAL SOUTH. 
WE ARE BLACK; INDIGENOUS; PEOPLE OF COLOUR. 

The language we use around the climate crisis can conceal as much as it reveals.

When referring to human-inflicted damage to the planet, westerners often implement a universal ""we."" This assumes an idea of a collective humanity destroying the Earth. In Netflix's ""A Life On Our Planet,"" David Attenborough warned: “This is now our planet, run by humankind for humankind. We’ve not just ruined it. We’ve destroyed it.”

But these sweeping terms—""humankind,"" ""our planet,"" and ""we""—fail to acknowledge some important truths. For example, that carbon emissions of the world's richest 1% are more than double those of the poorest half of the world or that 100 companies are responsible for 71% of global greenhouse gas emissions. 

Black, Indigenous, and other people of color in the Global South have historically contributed the least to global heating but are at disproportionate risk from its impacts—including drought, flooding, and food insecurity. Despite comprising just 5% of the world's population, Indigenous peoples protect 80% of global biodiversity. To homogenize the global population into a collective ""we"" is to allow those most responsible to evade accountability. 

When we talk about human-caused ecological devastation, language and context matter. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that disaster affects communities in different ways, and denying this is not just naive—but harmful. The same applies to the climate crisis. The most polluting should not be calling on the universal ""we"" to solve the catastrophe they have had such a pivotal role in producing.

Three more from the #SprayChalk6 had their bail conditions dropped ❤️✊

Laraine (pictured in images 2 and 3) says:

""The harsh treatment for chalking when Woodside can pollute with impunity is a sad indication of a captured state. What's a little bit of chalk compared to the damage caused by the emissions that will come from Scarborough gas? Who is the real criminal?""

Ben, another of the six, says: 

""I am absolutely delighted that I'm now able to associate with my friends and support network. This whole ordeal shows that the police have their priorities very wrong. The prosecutor argued that when we associate we participate in 'anti-social behaviour'. In fact, our actions are in the interest of social justice.""

Carmen (pictured in images 1,3 and 4) was the last to face court. She has also had her bail conditions lifted and says:

""I am very relieved that the magistrate has seen sense and removed these very onerous bail conditions. The case is not over yet, but at least I have my support network to get through it now. This example of blatant police over-reach, restricting my freedom to associate should be a concern to all Western Australians. It was washable chalk.""

Facebook's internal research into Instagram has raised serious concerns about the photo-sharing app's impact on the mental health of teens, prompting US lawmakers to press the world's largest social network for more answers.

For years, people have called out apps like Instagram for taking a toll on people's mental well-being. Instagram has been criticized by users, advocacy groups and lawmakers for harboring harmful content and fostering anxiety and depression, particularly among younger audiences. 

🚨Amidst all of this, we take a renewed effort to ALWAYS TELL THE TRUTH. 

Governments must tell the truth by declaring a climate and ecological emergency, working with other institutions to communicate the urgency for change.🚨

It’s Rebellion Day and Extinction Rebellion rebels are occupying three NYC bank headquarters in New York City. These banks are among the biggest investors in fossil fuel infrastructure – directly financing the causes of the climate crisis: JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, & Bank of America. 

Extinction Rebellion NYC and its supporters also gathered at noon outside the New York Public Library in Manhattan for a peaceful rally, “die-in” and march. The march weaved through Manhattan, stopping at the Brazilian consulate to protest that government’s destructive environmental policies regarding the Amazon region and then to the United Nations. The day’s events are the start of ongoing actions leading up to COP 26, the global conference that many consider a make or break event to get runaway global warming under control.

The morning of the 16th September, members of Ocean Rebellion staged a theatrical action
targeting the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) as the finale of their week-long calling out of
drivers of ocean degradation, including corrupt and destructive industrial fishing.

Protestors wearing pinstripe suits and fish head masks oozing blood and viscera stood in a
pool of blood and dead fish in the entrance to the MSC as workers arrived for the day. Thefish carried briefcases with slogans such as 𝗠𝗦𝗖 𝗖𝗘𝗥𝗧𝗜𝗙𝗜𝗘𝗗 𝗟𝗜𝗘𝗦 and 𝗪𝗔𝗥 𝗢𝗡 𝗙𝗜𝗦𝗛.

Protestors are demanding that the MSC stops selling lies to supermarket shoppers.
Currently the #marinestewardshipcouncil
makes no distinction between industrial fishing methods and artisan fishing methods on itslabelling.
The Marine Stewardship Council allows its members to obtain their certification by paying tojoin.
The campaigners contend this undermines the objectivity of the certification and makes itinherently corrupt.

DON’T DITCH IT🪡

Mass mending today as street stitchers lined up in front H&M, the world's second largest clothing manufacturer.

Our message: Stitch It. Don't Ditch It 🪡👚

The global fashion industry is responsible for 1.2 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year. That's more emissions than the shipping and aviation industries combined. 😯

Fast fashion needs to slow down! That's why we're outside H&M in Rundle Mall.

""But wait doesn't H&M offer a clothes recycling program?”

Yes! H&M recycle an extremely tiny fraction of what they sell. Their recycling program is widely seen as green washing.

The fast fashion industry will never be sustainable if they don't address the vast amounts of clothing they produce.

Recycling is important but it's only part of the solution. Unfortunately corporations often leverage recycling to push responsibility onto individuals and distance themselves from their own responsibility.

Mending enthusiast @localandbespoke said earlier:

""The 'joyful disruption' of #StitchItDontDitchIt is a quiet way to express our concern about the climate crisis that the majority of Australians want to see being met by decisive policy and urgent action on the part of government and corporations.”

You’ve seen the Met Gala pictures flooding your feeds. Fast Fashion is sometimes an affordable choice and sometimes the only choice for some people. Fashion companies on the other hand have a choice, to be better, to do better, to break away from fossil fuels and empty, shallow promises of sustainability. 

🗯Fashion is addicted to dirty oil. FACT.

⚡️Synthetic textiles are made from oil or gas both of which are socially and environmentally exploitative industries.

⚡️ Fashion is addicted to fossil fuels for the production of inexpensive, low-quality, throwaway fashion.

⚡️The fashion industry likes to pretend it cares - producing sustainable collections and sharing wishy washy commitments to reducing CO2 emissions by 2030 whilst the industry’s annual oil consumption to proceed synthetic textiles exceeds the annual oil consumption of Spain.

⚡️ The industry is on track to produce twice the volume but of emissions it requires to within the limited set by the Paris Agreement global warning pathways by 2030.

📢We demand an end to fossil fuel fashion. It's time the fashion industry cleaned up its act!

Yesterday (Saturday 11th September) members of Ocean Rebellion staged a creative theatrical action outside the entrance to Selfridges department store on Oxford Street in London. The protest was part of our week-long series of actions, calling out the drivers of ocean degradation. 

Members of the group dressed in Victorian swimming costumes and covered their skin in ‘sun cream’, whilst a banner read ‘YOUR FACE COSTS THE EARTH’. The action was highlighting the links between cosmetics and the toxic-forever chemicals washed into the ocean down our drains, or else applied directly by swimmers wearing suncream. 

Sophie Miller from Ocean Rebellion says “we demand that the government acts to ban the use of sun-screens and cosmetics containing oxybenzone and other coral-killing substances” 

Rob Higgs adds “The oceans are being poisoned by the toxic chemicals routinely added to consumer items such as cosmetics and sun-screens.  This is hitting the health of both the seas and the marine biodiversity that lives there.”

THE POLLUTANTS STORY

Don’t let anyone ever tell you that the solution to pollution is dilution of a toxic chemical or plastic – it isn’t! 

Some toxic-forever chemicals don’t ever disappear; there is simply no safe concentration. They don’t break down in the environment and they just keep on killing.  Even when they are diluted billions of times in the oceans, it doesn’t make any difference; they can get stuck onto particles of micro or nanoplastics where they get concentrated many millions or millions of times. 

These tiny pieces of plastic, now loaded with the toxic chemical(s) get consumed by plants and animals, the toxins accumulate, and kill them. Researchers are now reporting that 1 in 15 of all living organisms under the surface of the waves contains plastic, and this includes everything from the largest whale, down to a cyanobacteria.

📅 En el día de hoy, nos unimos desde diversos territorios para hacer un llamado de alerta frente a la amenaza del gobierno de Brasil 🇧🇷 contra el Amazonas y los pueblos originarios, quienes se encuentran atacados desde múltiples fronteras. 

⚠️ Actualmente peligra la demarcación de tierras indígenas cuyo objetivo tiene legalizar la toma de terrenos a favor de la industria extractivista 🚜 por sobre la vida de les habitantes y los ecosistemas. 

✊ Alzamos la voz en contra del paquete de leyes que favorece la ya acelerada tasa de deforestación vista en los últimos años, lo cual podría llevar a los ecosistemas por encima del punto límite, implicando que se emita más dióxido de carbono de lo que puede absorber. 🌳
 
🚜 Gran parte de la deforestación en Brasil se encuentra vinculada con intercambios económicos 💲 con Italia, Francia, Reino Unido, Alemania y España. Uno de los más recientes ejemplos se enmarca dentro del acuerdo entre la Unión Europea – Mercosur que perpetúa la continua demanda de productos agroindustriales 🌾desde los países latinoamericanos explotando los territorios y causando la degradación de ecosistemas y los pueblos que se encuentran a su alrededor. ☠️

☠️Otro claro ejemplo de las repercusiones causadas por la devastación del amazonas es la situación actual de sequía histórica del rio Paraná.

Paren el ecocidio, paren el terricidio. 🔥

Big oil coined the phrase ‘carbon footprint’ to blame us for their greed – and while climate-conscious individual choices are good, they're not nearly enough to save the planet. More than personal virtue, we need collective action, writes columnist Rebecca Solnit.

In her piece for @guardian_us, she looks at how “the very short counterargument that individual acts of thrift and abstinence ... won’t get us the huge distance we need to go in this decade"".

So what do we need to do instead?

We need to exit the age of fossil fuels, reinvent our energy landscape, rethink how we do almost everything.

“The revolution won’t happen by people staying home and being good.""

Demonstrators set up a Green New Deal Village in the middle of Route 28 the four-lane highway between the MOCO Executive and Council Buildings to block lunchtime traffic. The Village included the top three demands of the MOCO GND.

In order of priority, some pushed wheelbarrows carrying plants symbolizing the top demand for community gardens and a more resilient and healthy food supply.

Others wore electricians' hard hats and carried the solar panels and  heat pumps that must replace methane/”natural” gas in all MOCO buildings, the second GND demand.

Finally, one young person played a school teacher driving a police office away from the school representing the GND demand for “counselors not cops.”

Five MOCO young people arrested, age 13-17, demanding a MOCO Green New Deal;
Over 100 block traffic in Rockville in largest-ever MOCO climate demonstration.

We are standing on a precipice. We can acknowledge the truth of what we are facing, or we can continue to kick the can down the road and allow the effects of a heating planet to have even more detrimental outcomes on all living beings. We are already locked in to a certain amount of warming and biodiversity loss, but there is still time to change this story.

This crisis knows no borders, race or ethnicity, and while wealth may offer some protection, it is all but temporary. The clock is ticking, and if we don’t succeed in uniting to protect our planet, everyone will be impacted - you, your family, everyone and everything you hold dear…

Evidenciamos que en plena crisis climática el gobierno colombiano, (en complicidad con) Exxonmobil y Ecopetrol desean destruir y contaminar la región del Magdalena Medio. ☣️💀 Mediante los 'pilotos de Fracking', romperán el suelo y e introducirán un ducto que recorrerá 4km del subsuelo a nivel vertical y horizontal.  Aplicarán 47millones de litros de agua y más de 300 sustancias químicas que terminarán contaminando las fuentes hídricas del subsuelo y superficie de Puerto Wilches.
.
Traerá consigo impactos negativos en la vida, salud, economía y cultura de la población wilchense. No sólo contaminará y dañará completamente las fuentes hídricas de la región; también amenazara las especies en vía de extinción, la calidad del aire, generará enfermedades cancerígenas y desplazará masivamente las especies humanas y no humanas del Magdalena Medio.

Hurricane Ida has a million people in Louisiana without electricity or running water. The Caldor Fire is forcing mass evacuations around Lake Tahoe and all public parks in California have been forced to close. Siberia continues to burn.

If the mainstream media won’t report the links between the climate crisis and EXCESS BURNING OF FOSSIL FUELS, as these extreme weather events are happening … when will they ever #TellTheTruth? We need journalists to have the courage to do responsible reporting. 

After months of persistent protesting at @NBCUniversal @NBCNews @TodayShow, the news outlet has made it more difficult for us to confront them… instead of focusing on improving their coverage on the climate and ecological emergency. We will not back down!

Thank you XR REBELS! 💚🙌🏼

We are the change. We are the rebellion. 

Rebels came together, mothers, kids, young people, people from all walks of life. We know we are powerful when we decide to face the climate and ecological emergency together.

The crisis will impact us differently, and we heard yesterday how it will impact women and young people, which is why we want a democracy that truly represents everyone, to decide together, how we get out of this mess.

XR GLOBAL INVITA A LOS GRUPOS XR DEL NORTE Y DEL SUR

ACOMPÁÑANOS EN UNA SERIE DE SENCILLAS ACCIONES DE ""PASA EL MICRO"" DESDE AHORA HASTA EL COP26 Y MÁS ALLÁ.

En agosto, septiembre y octubre, más de 50 activistas del sur darán breves charlas sobre cómo les afectan las crisis de la naturaleza y el clima a nivel local.
Luego, durante la COP26, el sur global estallará con historias y acciones para destacar la urgencia de la acción necesaria sobre el terreno.
Tradicionalmente, estas voces se ven ahogadas por los medios de comunicaciones más sofisticadas y con más recursos, por lo que los activistas de primera línea se están asociando con grupos de solidaridad del norte. Los grupos del norte global reenvían y publican, dan ""likes"" y siguen e intentan difundir en sus canales de redes sociales los mensajes y las acciones del sur global.

En août, septembre et octobre, plus de 50 militants des pays du Sud donneront de brèves conférences sur la façon dont les crises de la nature et du climat les affectent localement.

Ensuite, au cours de la COP26, les pays du Sud proposeront des histoires et des actions pour souligner l’urgence d’une action sur le terrain. Traditionnellement, ces voix sont noyées par des informations issues de sources bien lissées. C’est pourquoi les militantes en première ligne de la crise climatique font équipe avec des groupes de solidarité des pays du Nord. Les groupes du Nord republient et publient, aiment et suivent et essaient de faire passer sur leurs canaux de réseaux sociaux les messages et les actions du Sud.

The effects of ‘weird weather’ were already being felt in the 1960s, but scientists linking fossil fuels with climate change were dismissed as prophets of doom. 

In August 1974, the CIA produced a study on “climatological research as it pertains to intelligence problems”“The climate change began in 1960,” the report’s first page informs us, “but no one, including the climatologists, recognised it.” Crop failures in the Soviet Union and India in the early 1960s had been attributed to standard unlucky weather. 

But, the report argued, the world ignored this warning, as the global population continued to grow and states made massive investments in energy, technology and medicine. As the effects of climate change started to spread to other parts of the world, the early 1970s saw reports of droughts, crop failures and floods from Burma, Pakistan, North Korea, Costa Rica, Honduras, Japan, Manila, Ecuador, USSR, China, India and the US. But few people seemed willing to see a pattern: “The headlines from around the world told a story still not fully understood or one we don’t want to face,” the report said*

⚡Today four members of Extinction Rebellion Fashion Action glued themselves to the front door of Selfridges on Oxford Street to sound the alarm about the fashion industry's addiction to dirty Oil. One rebel poured fake oil on them. All five have been arrested. 

⚡They were wearing a dress inspired by designer Issey Miyake's 'A Piece of Cloth' (APOC) which displayed the messages: 'Fashion is addicted to dirty oil' and 'Code red for fossil fuel fashion'.

⚡Other members of the protest poured fake oil over the activists and then proceeded to pour fake oil over the windows of the iconic British department store to further highlight the fashion industry's increasing reliance on fossil fuels, especially Oil. Meanwhile, other rebels occupied Oxford Street with samba. 

⛽From fast-fashion to high-end luxury, the fashion industry and its prevailing model rely heavily on the use of cheap synthetic fibres, which are produced from oil and gas. Since the early 2000s, fashion production has doubled - as has the use of polyester, which is now found in over half of textiles.

⛽Selfridges Group is owned by the Weston family, who also own Primark. Primark appeared as one of the worst contenders in the Changing Markets report 'Synthetics Anonymous: Fashion Brands' Addiction to Fossil Fuels, appearing in the red zone for 'transparency, use of synthetic fibres and commitments to phase them out'.

⛽Changing Markets Foundation found that it wasn't just fast fashion that relied the most on fossil fuels. The other brands in the red and yellow zones include Adidas, Nike, Puma, Burberry, and Calvin Klein, all of which are stocked in Selfridges.

WE ARE THE GLOBAL SOUTH. 
WE ARE BLACK; INDIGENOUS; PEOPLE OF COLOUR. 

The language we use around the climate crisis can conceal as much as it reveals.

When referring to human-inflicted damage to the planet, westerners often implement a universal ""we."" This assumes an idea of a collective humanity destroying the Earth. In Netflix's ""A Life On Our Planet,"" David Attenborough warned: “This is now our planet, run by humankind for humankind. We’ve not just ruined it. We’ve destroyed it.”

But these sweeping terms—""humankind,"" ""our planet,"" and ""we""—fail to acknowledge some important truths. For example, that carbon emissions of the world's richest 1% are more than double those of the poorest half of the world or that 100 companies are responsible for 71% of global greenhouse gas emissions. 

Black, Indigenous, and other people of color in the Global South have historically contributed the least to global heating but are at disproportionate risk from its impacts—including drought, flooding, and food insecurity. Despite comprising just 5% of the world's population, Indigenous peoples protect 80% of global biodiversity. To homogenize the global population into a collective ""we"" is to allow those most responsible to evade accountability. 

When we talk about human-caused ecological devastation, language and context matter. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that disaster affects communities in different ways, and denying this is not just naive—but harmful. The same applies to the climate crisis. The most polluting should not be calling on the universal ""we"" to solve the catastrophe they have had such a pivotal role in producing.

Stand in solidarity with the indigenous nations of Brazil along with @xrczech in their action on Prague's Wenceslas Square.

🚨This very Wednesday, the Supreme Court of Brazil will vote on a bill which could remove protection from natural reserves, allowing the government to even futher abuse and destroy their valuable rainforests.🚨

If the deforestation of the Amazon continues, we will soon reach a tipping point from which the rainforest, and our planet, will not recover. The actions of the Brazilian government and president Bolsonaro are putting the future of all of us, along with one of the Earth's most precious ecosystems, at risk.

We strongly urge all of you to act, join the #all4theamazon and #hauxhauxmovement campaign and let your disagreement be heard.

Together, united, we can still prevent the worst outcomes of the climate crisis.

📣 Gobiernos y Corporaciones, grandes accionistas: en esta era donde el hiperconsumo y la individualidad generan una división ficticia e ilusoria sobre lo que realmente somos en conjunto: NATURALEZA, es muy difícil sentir los gritos de los animales en los humedales quemándose como algo de lo que somos responsables, ver las llamas desde la orilla de enfrente como consecuencia de actos que generamos, inhalar el humo y acostumbrarnos a no poder salir de nuestras viviendas por momentos como causa de malas decisiones. 🔥

❌ Cientos de miles de especies muertas, otras desorientadas en la ciudad, personas en las guardias de los hospitales con graves problemas para respirar, y el final, un ecosistema devastado pero listo para el extractivismo que nos lleva a la ruina.

💀 Si no hay biodiversidad la muerte es lo que sigue. 💀

🌍Si son responsables, si quieren que todas las especies vivan, si quieren que esta generación de humanes y la que está naciendo vivan y lo hagan en un universo posible, no hay otra alternativa que ACTUAR AHORA, frenar el ecocidio YA y abrir la DEMOCRACIA. ✊

ARE YOU READY FOR THE NORDIC REBELLION?

Bli med Extinction Rebellion og vanlige folk fra hele Norden på en historisk stor sivil ulydighetsaksjon i Oslo 21.-29. august! Norge må ta et valg: Skal vi fortsette å velge penger, utbygging, industri og olje hver gang det kommer i konflikt med liv og natur? Eller skifte kurs før det er for sent?

XR fremmer to hovedkrav i aksjonsuka: “La olja ligge” og “liv foran vekst”. Olje og gass er Norges største synd. Våre nordiske venner kommer for å be oss slutte å rasere verden for oljepenger, før det er for sent. Extinction Rebellion forlanger rask utfasing av produksjon på norsk sokkel - og umiddelbar letestans.

I tillegg setter XR økonomisk vekst på dagsorden. Skal vi fortsette å rasere natur og klima for penger? Gjennom aksjoner, gatekunst og festivaler viser vi hva dette betyr. Enten det gjelder gruvedeponi i fjorden, motorveier, ny rullebane, oljefelt, hyttefelt, lakseoppdrett, rasering av matjord, skog eller dyrevelferd: Regjeringen må sette liv foran økonomisk vekst.

------

Vi bruker sivil ulydighet i våre aksjoner. Det er fordi vi mener det er nødvendig for å få til rask endring. Det har vist seg å fungere før, og vil fungere igjen om vi er mange nok. Ditt mot er nødvendig for å endre vårt giftige system!

XR Université de Goma!

Alongside our amplifying of XR Vaal and XR Makassar XR Sheffield’s Justice group have formed a partnership with XR Université de Goma. 

This groups is based in the Democratic Republic of the Congo very close to Virunga National Park and have asked us to help them with some crowdfunding to support them. There bold plans focus around fighting at all costs against oil exploitation in Virunga National Park, a world heritage site with one of the planet’s last surviving populations of mountain gorillas. 

This passionate group of ecologist’s actions so far have included educating in schools and communities, creative and peaceful actions around water preservation and against fossil fuel exploitation.

Stay tuned to hear more about the crowdfunder and a Q and A event with the group, but in the mean time here are some photos of their actions!

In August, September and October over 50 activists from the global south will give brief talks on how the crises in nature and climate are affecting them locally. 

Then during COP26 the global south will erupt with stories and actions to highlight the urgency of action needed on the ground.
Traditionally, these voices are drowned out by slicker, well-resourced media, which is why frontline activists are teaming up with solidarity groups in the global north.  Groups in the global north repost and post, like and follow and try to push out across their social media channels messages and actions from the global south.

Rebellions in Mendoza, Argentina where fracking is having disastrous impacts on water and a solidarity action in Ireland. Climate activists tried to shut down gas terminals and protested fracking plans in several countries on July 30, as a post-lockdown push to influence the agenda ahead of November's COP26 climate summit in Scotland kicks off in earnest.

Up to 3,000 activists from Germany's Ende Gelaende, a green civil disobedience movement, blocked the Brunsbuttel liquefied natural gas terminal in a bid to stop operations. Campaigners also took to the streets in a dozen countries including Argentina, Ireland, Bolivia and Canada.

In a strategic shift, they are targeting gas rather than coal plants, and linking actions in the Global North and South. Their target is European multinationals that are doing abroad what they cannot do at home - namely fracking. The action also intends to create space for the climate movement in Scotland to regroup and rebuild momentum in the run-up to COP26.

Wunderbar bunte und kreative Impressionen erreichen uns vom #Uprising-Festival dieses Wochenende, mit dem der morgen startende #AugustRiseUp in Berlin eingeleitet wird! 
An zwei Tagen wurden dort Vorträge gehalten, Trainings gegeben, Reden gehalten, Musik performt, Textilien bedruckt, Kipppunkte-Jenga gespielt und vieles mehr.

Und am Bahnhof Wannsee haben sich heute hunderte Menschen mit Rädern getroffen, um über die AVUS nach Berlin zu fahren. 

Am Bundesverkehrsministerium wurde sich mit den vier Fingern des @adfc_berlin zu einer großen Kundgebung getroffen, dann ging es weiter zum Festival des @augustriseup!

Bei all dem waren wir natürlich auch dabei und sind voller Vorfreude auf die kommende Woche. Bist du dabei? 🤞

Posted @withregram • @xrebellionuk IMAGINE THE COLLAPSE⁣
⁣
Imagine water sources are scarce, while some countries continue to burn fossil fuels, people go hungry, wars break out, societies collapse, this is not just about the weather, this is about what happens to society as these drastic weather events increase...⁣
⁣
IMAGINE THE CITIZENS⁣
⁣
Imagine people are empowered to come together, and take part in direct and deliberative democracy. Imagine they immediately end all new fossil fuels, and work on a plan to phase the rest out by 2025. Imagine they kick start communities coming together to face the crisis through rewilding and food growing projects across the country.... this is not just about the weather, this is about what happens to communities when you involve them in decision making....⁣
⁣
IMAGINE THE CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE⁣
⁣
We've seen throughout history what it's taken for people to create change. Now it's up to us all to imagine and then organise the movement which will lead us away from water shortages, famine, war, and fascism and towards communities coming together to tackle the climate emergency...⁣

Five rebels appeared in court on August 5th after disruptive rally and road blocks outside the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment in Canberra.

🎨✊🎨

Taking our message directly to Environment Minister @susanleymp Grandmother Lesley and registered nurse Daisy were arrested after scrawling ""Duty of care"" in red paint across a wall outside the department. Both were charged.

👴🌏💚

Grandfather and former CSIRO scientist Nick, who covered department signage in red paint, had all of his charges dropped. A win for nonviolent civil disobedience and targeted property damage in light of the climate emergency.

Nick told the courts that he would ""continue to break the law if that's what it takes to avert a major catastrophe.""

🚗🚙🚗

Disruption spilt onto the streets as a youth-led march created road closures and disrupted peak hour traffic on Kings Avenue Bridge. Rebels Violet and Mark were arrested after obstructing roads and refusing to comply with police requests to move on. Their case has been adjourned till August 14th.

The stakes could not be higher. The Earth is already too hot.

Resist annihilation. Join with XR.

""Black, Indigenous, and other people of colour in the Global South have historically contributed the least to global heating but are at disproportionate risk from its impacts—including drought, flooding, and food insecurity.

🌏El viernes 30 de julio el Sur y el Norte Global se unieron contra el fracking, con acciones en Argentina, Colombia, Canadá, Alemania, Irlanda, y EEUU.

💀Las petroleras que extraen gas fósil del Sur Global y lo importan al Norte Global están cometiendo colonialismo climático.

😡La búsqueda de gas de esquisto (shale gas) ha provocado la contaminación de la tierra, el agua y el aire, así como la devastación de los pueblos originarios y sus tierras, y un impacto social desastroso en comunidades locales.

❌La cadena de suministro del fracking en Vaca Muerta, conformada por Chevron, Shell, Total y Pan American Energy (respaldada por British Petroleum), sus financiadores y en general los partidarios del desarrollo del gas de esquisto en la región, se encuentran en los centros de poder europeos y estadounidenses.

✊🏾Es necesario apoyar las luchas de las comunidades del Sur Global que pelean contra estas empresas, y poner de relieve los vínculos de esas empresas nacionales con las del Norte Global.

📢Denunciamos el fraude climático de los países europeos, que importan gas proveniente de fracturación hidráulica (fracking) para mantener limpio su récord de emisiones.

🔥¡No al fracking! ¡No al gas fósil!

Climate change does not affect us equally but no more can even those in the Global North sit back watching from a plush chair. It is devastating lives and wrecking havoc with every passing day. Nowhere is safe. The time to act is now, and treat this crisis as the alarming emergency it is. 

“​​It is unequivocal.”

Those three words are the first in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s new report - their starkest warning yet on global heating.

It has laid out how the climate crisis is unequivocally caused by human activities and is unequivocally affecting every corner of the planet’s land, air and sea already.

The report, produced by hundreds of the world’s top scientists and signed off by all the world’s governments, says within the next two decades temperatures are likely to rise by more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels bringing widespread devastation and extreme weather.

The collapse of major Atlantic currents, ice caps, or the Amazon rainforest “cannot be ruled out”, the report warns.

António Guterres, the UN secretary-general, warned: “[This report] is a code red for humanity. The alarm bells are deafening, and the evidence is irrefutable: greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and deforestation are choking our planet and putting billions of people at immediate risk.”

But the report is clear that there are no cliff-edges to the climate crisis. Each tonne of carbon pumped out increases the impacts and risks of extreme heat, floods and droughts and so every tonne of carbon matters. It will never be too late to act, the report shows. Instead, the real question is how bad will it get?

On Sunday rebels from across the UK came together with many movements in support of the Afrikan Emancipation Day Reparations Rebellion Groundings to block Brixton Road. It took place on Afrikan Emancipation Day, commemorated in the Caribbean and some parts of Africa marking the passing of the 1833 Abolition of Slavery Act.⁣
⁣
The Reparations Rebellion adopts a broad definition of reparations beyond monetary compensation, towards a focus on repair and stopping the harm. To this end, the roadblock reduced air pollution in Brixton and provided a space, to come together as community, including creating a Global Citizens Garden. People from all walks of life came together to prefigure what Planet Repairs and reparatory justice means for our communities. The day practically envisioned the future world devoid of ecocide which we demand. ⁣

A lot has changed in Yellowstone Park in the past twenty-five years. Healthy stands of willow trees line the banks of streams. Songbirds sing from tree branches. Beaver dams made of willow dot the streams. If you’re lucky, you can spot a beaver slapping its tail on the surface of the water. Twenty-five years ago, it would’ve been difficult to find any of these species. What changed? And what made this healthy ecosystem possible? In one word: wolves.

“The apocalypse I’ve been bracing myself for seems to be right on our doorstep. After historic flooding across Germany, record heatwaves and droughts, now massive wildfires are sweeping across Turkey (sparked intentionally or by negligence, but able to spread because of high temperatures and wind). This is like watching a car crash in slow motion. Maybe instead of jetting off to space billionaires could try salvage this planet. Wake up world, we’re in a climate emergency.”

“All my love to anyone living through this, for those wanting to support Turkey I’ll share links to stories.”

Even though the cause of the wildfire has not been identified and/or linked to arsonists its important to note and remember that:

‼️Climate change has inexorably stacked the deck in favor of bigger and more intense fires.‼️

Speaking ahead of the action, Tim said:

‘I’m sewing up my lips to demonstrate the terrible and violent havoc Murdoch’s actions have reaped upon the world and to symbolically make visible this truth. Today there are countless people throughout the world who are voiceless and suffering because of the climate emergency. Climate science and truth has been muted and those who suffer are not being heard. I have tried everything other way I can think of to end the influences and madness represented by Rupert Murdoch and his denial of the climate emergency.’

Extinction Rebellion Cape Town calls for a halt to all oil and gas drilling. Authorisation of new oil and gas activities runs contrary to South Africa’s climate change commitments, including its commitment to the Paris Climate Agreement.

Natural gas is not a clean form of energy. The drilling and extraction of natural gas from wells and its transportation in pipelines results in the leakage of methane which is a very, very powerful greenhouse gas.

30 million hectares are to be returned to indigenous governance. Deforestation has dropped 75%.

But what is the true picture? 

The Widodo administration have managed to pass bills that kills environmental protection, increase support for extractive industries especially coal, removes the space for civilians to contest corporation for operational license and allows criminalisation of communities that blocks any corporation activities in conflict land. We have also seen sharp increase of land grabbing incidences, criminalisation of indigenous communities and our only anti corruption eradication body have effectively been killed. 

Even though we have policies officially in place for land grants, giving land back to indigenous control, the progress is extremely slow and the policy for moratorium palm oil is done without any enforcement, along with additional conflicting laws that makes it possible to still destroy forests. Also they have started a new program called Food Estate which is legally allowed to even use the space of protected forest to turn into monoculture fields of industrial farming, which already has been proven to fail, but they're still going ahead using military power to make. Worth mentioning that 16 out of 30 of Widodo's cabinet ministers are mining industry players and 55% of the current house parliament seats are business owners. We are at our lowest point for environmental protection as well as democracy.😢 

And although the deforestation rate has decreased as a whole country, it is partially due to the forest area already dwindling from the previously deforested islands. But they have now started moving to the east where deforestation has increased in Papua instead. In today's world, we need deforestation to be negative, which is very possible because we have 14 million hectares of degraded land ready to be rehabilitated using funds from Norway but yet to be used because corporations still love to take logs to sell in the international market. 

There is still so much work to do. Support the work of @extinctionrebellion.id

Makassar, Indonesia – A number of activists from Extinction Rebellion Makassar staged a demonstration at Lego-lego Central Point of Indonesia (CPI), Makassar City. Activists urged a more ambitious climate action plan and implementation of climate change control in line with the Paris Agreement to President Joko Widodo and the Indonesian delegation at COP26. Saturday, July 24, 2021.

The action, which comes 100 days before the UNFCCC COP26 Climate Change Negotiations Conference, demands, first of all, to declare a climate emergency. 

The actions taken are based on concerns about the impact of the climate crisis and the disasters that many world researchers predict will hit Indonesia in the future if climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts are not ambitious.

In the report of the international climate change research institute, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2018, it was stated that Indonesia is now one of the countries that is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, because it is an archipelagic country with a tropical climate.

The World Meteorological Agency (WMO) states that the earth is already at a temperature rise of 1.2ºC. With the current increase in temperature, as many as 5.5 million Indonesians have become victims and have had to evacuate and suffer in the first 6 months of 2021.

On July 10 and 11, 2021, the First National Environmental People’s Assembly was held in Colombia.
.
The face-to-face meeting took place in Támesis, Antioquia; a territory that has resisted the mega-mining company Anglo Gold Ashanti, who intends to destroy mountains, rivers, trees and endemic species of this incredible place.
.
The indigenous reservations of the south west of Antioquia, peasant communities of Támesis (who work for environmental education and the recognition of their territory), movements, collectives and socio-environmental organizations from all over the country were present.
.
Throughout the day, diagnoses were made on environmental problems at the national level, concerns, proposals and expectations were expressed from communication, mobilization, articulation of territories, political and legal work, among others.
.
We are pleased to show the achievements and objectives that have emerged from the territories and communities and wish to position themselves in the next National People’s Assembly.

This #SharkWeek, reflect on the irreplaceable role these magnificent predators play in keeping ocean ecosystems healthy. They are misunderstood, sensationalized, criminalized and exploited. We need to stop. Now. 

‼️Sharks keep our oceans healthy. If our oceans die, we die. Period. ‼️

Sharks emerged long before dinosaurs and have evolved over 400 million years. They exist in diverse ecosystems, from the deep sea to freezing Arctic waters to tropical coral reefs and mangrove forests, and stabilize these ecosystems by eating prey. Sharks are some of the most diversified and abundant top predators in the marine food web, and if you remove sharks, you threaten to damage the entire system.

‼️Stop the Killing of Sharks Now ‼️

#SharkAwarenessDay is an opportunity to separate fact from myth and celebrate these incredible marine animals who have lived in our oceans for millions of years. As top predators, sharks serve a critical role in maintaining the balance of our ocean’s most vulnerable ecosystems.

‼️Humans have driven many species of sharks to the brink of extinction, and today we are asking you to help us protect endangered sharks in Costa Rica. ‼️

Earlier this year, President @Carlosalvq signed an executive decree that gutted vital protections, leaving endangered sharks vulnerable to extinction.

Join us on only.one/costarica (link in our bio) to urge the Costa Rican President to immediately repeal his harmful executive decree and restore the Ministry of Environment’s authority to conserve and protect sharks.

Even before dinosaurs came to be, sharks were flourishing as top predators in the earth’s oceans. They are marvels of evolution and symbols of a healthy marine ecosystem.

All around the world, hundreds of species of sharks are facing extinction, largely due to overfishing and human exploitation. Declines in shark populations can lead to cascading negative effects in marine ecosystems because they play a vital role in the food web, and are also responsible for the circulation and transfer of nutrients. Shark conservation is critical to the overall health of our oceans.

In Costa Rica, the situation is especially urgent. The country has more than 40 species of sharks, and almost half are in serious danger of extinction, including silky sharks and hammerhead sharks. Despite presenting itself as a conservation leader, Costa Rica is failing to protect hammerhead sharks (the country’s national marine conservation symbol). 

Earlier this year, Costa Rica’s government essentially legalized the overfishing, and subsequent extinction, of endangered sharks. Indeed, President @carlosalvq removed the ability of the Ministry of Environment to protect sharks, and shifted management responsibilities to the Institute of Fisheries and Aquaculture (INCOPESCA) – meaning they are no longer protected by Costa Rica’s Wildlife Conservation Law.

We are asking President Alvarado to immediately repeal his harmful executive decree and restore the Ministry of Environment’s authority to conserve and protect sharks. Join the campaign at the link in our bio (only.one/costarica) and share the #petition to help spread the word.

‼️ Stop the Killing of Sharks ‼️ - only.one/costarica 

There are 40 species of sharks in Costa Rica. A quarter of them face IMMINENT EXTINCTION. 

The Shark Population has DECLINED BY 50% IN THE LAST 50 YEARS. 

For example, In Costa Rica, the population of hammerhead sharks is rapidly heading towards extinction. If the trend continues, the global population could be completely extinct in just 20 years. We can’t let this happen. 

For a country that prides itself on protecting its endangered marine wildlife, #CostaRica is doing an abysmal job of stemming the alarming decline of endangered shark species in its waters. Earlier this year, President @carlosalvq signed an executive decree that gutted vital protections, leaving endangered sharks even more vulnerable to extinction. The President removed the ability of the Ministry of Environment to protect sharks and shifted management responsibilities to the unqualified Institute of Fisheries and Aquaculture (INCOPESCA). 

Now, we are asking President Alvarado to immediately repeal his harmful executive decree and restore the Ministry of Environment’s authority to conserve and protect sharks.

Hammerheads and silky sharks are the two most commonly caught sharks. Snagged on long lines that can be many miles in length with hundreds of baited hooks (intended to fish mahi mahi). 

‼️85 percent of the dead sharks haven't even reached maturity.‼️

The Costa Rican government recently essentially legalized the overfishing and subsequent extinction of endangered sharks, even those species afforded protections through international conventions like CITES.

With Argentina’s men’s football team winning the Copa America and the Euro 2020 final taking place soon we thought we should remind fans that there’s no football on a dead planet. 

You will not be surprised to know that football will not be spared in the climate and ecological crisis. And the football’s governing bodies are only really concerned about endless growth and greed.

Fifa and Uefa are looking to expand almost all of their tournaments, with new tournaments being created by the year (it would seem) - something that neither fans nor teams particularly want to see. The Concacaf Gold Cup, the Africa Cup of Nations and the AFC Asian Cup have also expanded their tournaments. With 70% of football’s emissions coming from spectator travel, the expansion of these tournaments is incompatible with a living planet. It’s that simple. 

If football’s governing bodies really cared about its future they would be enacting positive climate and ecological related changes themselves and demanding action from our governments. Football relies on a stable climate. 

Without action, we will see temperatures (35C+) that will make it harder for both fans and players. At that temperature, we can expect heat cramps, heat exhaustion, heatstroke and loss of memory, hand-eye coordination and concentration. Meaning professional, grassroots, and informal football will become intolerable.

By 2050, we could see Werder Bremen’s Weserstadion and Bordeaux’s Matmut Atlantique flooded annually. In England, 23 of the 92 league grounds can expect partial or total annual flooding of their stadiums by 2050. Similar fates await estuarine and coastal stadiums everywhere.

Can football be saved? 

Yes, but first a few necessary steps would need to be taken:

1. Football needs to declare a climate and ecological emergency 
2. Say no to all championship expansion, embracing a less is more philosophy 
3. Stop all fossil fuel investment and sponsorship 
4. Stop all banking investment and sponsorship from banks and financial institutes that contribute to the climate and ecological crisis

⁣
#TellTheTruth
#ActNow!⁣
No gas exploration! Seismic testing kills!⁣
⁣
On 1 July, the Andrews government lifted the ban on gas exploration, both onshore and offshore, with plans to explore for gas within five kilometres of the Twelve Apostles. ⁣
⁣
HELLO WE ARE IN A CLIMATE AND ECOLOGICAL EMERGENCY, DAN 🤪🤯⁣

Seismic testing blasts from gas exploration are so loud that they penetrate through the ocean and kilometres into the seafloor. They inflict violent disruption on marine life, including whales and dolphins, resulting in hearing loss and death⁣
⁣
🚫 Yeah, no thanks 🚫⁣
⁣
And what of economic hardship for Warrnambool? Warrnambool’s economy relies heavily on tourism from whale watching. Dead whales, indeed no whales, will decimate tourism. Fugly gas rigs, leaks or spills won’t bloody help either!⁣
⁣
""To expand fossil fuel extraction, rather than an emergency shut down of the fossil fuel industry, is insanity. We simply cannot keep doing this and expect everything to be okay,” says XR spokesperson Miriam Robinson.⁣
⁣
“…our governments are enslaved by fossil fuel interests.""⁣
⁣
Gas exploration in the turbulent waters off the Southern Ocean is as irresponsible as it is absurd!⁣
⁣
It’s hard to believe state and federal governments STILL need reminding that we are in a #ClimateEmergency. They must #TellTheTruth about the climate emergency and #ActNow!⁣

While they explore earth emotions like grief and despair, the Reds remind us that there is still hope should the government #ActNow by keeping fossil fuels in the sea floor.⁣

U sklopu performansa, troje aktivista koji su predstavljali Vlade, banke i fosilnu industriju simbolično su razbili stari i neupotrebljivi, no svejedno simboličan klima uređaj, uz transparent kojim smo zapitali građane “Što biste vi učinili da vam uništavaju klimu?”.

Da vam netko uništi vaš klima uređaj, to bi vas svakako uzrujalo, pa zašto vas onda ne uzrujava još veća razina uništenja – uništenje klime, Planete i živih vrsta? 

Kada pričamo o klimi, kao da pričamo o nečemu dalekom, neopipljivom, pa dolazi do raspršenja odgovornosti i osjećaja bespomoćnosti za djelovanje na zaustavljanju klimatskih promjena. Tako biva sve dok te promjene ne osjetimo na vlastitoj koži, kao što ih posljednjih dana osjećamo kroz toplinske udare, a znanstvena zajednica upozorava da će to biti sve učestalije.

Oggi, nel terzo giorno di meeting del G20 su Economia e Finanza, abbiamo denunciato le morti causate dal collasso climatico, ecologico e sociale, di cui le grandi potenze del G20 sono responsabili e complici.

Secondo l’Organizzazione Mondiale della Sanità, il collasso climatico causa circa 150.000 morti l’anno. 

Secondo il report Global Climate Risk Index 2021, negli ultimi vent'anni 475 mila persone hanno perso la vita a causa di eventi climatici estremi, i quali hanno provocato un totale di circa duemila miliardi di euro di danni economici.

Le delegazioni dei paesi del G20 sono responsabili del 75% delle emissioni globali di CO2 (Climate Transparency Report 2020).

Sono rinchiuse in questi giorni in una fortezza inaccessibile alla cittadinanza, per discutere di politiche economiche globali le cui ripercussioni avranno esiti sulle sorti dell’intera umanità.

Noi vogliamo portare negli spazi pubblici le paure per le catastrofi che l’umanità dovrà affrontare, secondo quanto dichiara da decenni la scienza mondiale!

Chiediamo con forza che le decisioni sul nostro futuro siano prese in contesti democratici e inclusivi, con il coinvolgimento della cittadinanza e della società civile.

Perché i governi hanno fallito e ci stanno ingannando.

I loro soldi, il nostro sangue.

Recent satellite images reveal the scale of deforestation occuring in Bugoma forest reserve as Hoima Sugar company expands its land use deep inside the forest, and others encroach from outside. 

When Hoima Sugar was given premission to log and plant sugar cane in Hoima forest Forest, in 2016, the National Forestry Authority of Uganda took the matter to the High Court.  Yet, despite this forest being home to some of the world's most endangered species, including chimpanzees, and despite each hectare of land being worth $28,000 in carbon sequestration alone, the National Forestry Authority of Uganda lost the court case to protect this land. 

The satellite images reveal just how fast the decline is happening and  that we need to stand behind the earth defenders on the frontline protecting this forest.  The National Forestry Authority wardens are often subjected to violence and it is hard for local people to publicly support the forest for fear of reprisals. 

Around the world we stand united and strong. You have to act now! #climatecrisisishere

It has been a scary few weeks and climate anxiety is very real. If you feel overwhelmed and anxious about the climate problem, you are not alone. 

When it comes to climate change, fear isn’t enough to motivate long-term, sustained action. It may spur a short-term response; but long-term, it will paralyze us. 

What we actually need is efficacy – the understanding that if we act, we can make a difference in ourselves, in others, and in the world around us. And one of the best ways to build efficacy, in ourselves and others, is to look for examples of what other people like us are doing -- and share them --- and do them!

Dr Asmamaw, a UK doctor from Ethiopia:

 'Climate change is a crisis affecting the African continent more than any other ' 

'desertification, changing weather and famine are becoming more and more frequent'

'the long history of slavery, colonialism followed by post-colonial policies have served to keep Africa trapped in poverty. '

'This makes their health systems fragile and the catastrophes they have suffered, include losing millions to the HIV pandemic, enduring several ebola outbreaks, only to now be going through the covid pandemic. '

In May 2018 the name ‘Extinction Rebellion’ was first used in the formative Art Group meeting.

Since then it has been chanted on the streets all over the world.

This name is under threat.

Intellectual Property (IP) is as ‘strange' as the system it sprang from. In IP land anyone can apply to own a brand even if they didn’t create it. Over the past eighteen months we have successfully stopped people fraudulently claiming the rights to our work. Now we want to secure the name for the movement forever and ensure it remains out of the hands of commercial interests.

With your help we can ensure no one can claim our work, it will remain true to the copyright description on our website, forever. 

This may not sound like a big deal. But it is. If we don’t own the IP ourselves then someone, somewhere, will claim it. This is a danger to our social media accounts, our websites and other communication channels. And, when we own it, we can issue ‘cease and desist’ orders to platforms that sell fake merchandise, social media accounts that ‘pass off’ and fake affiliations.

It also means we can continue working together to co-create wonderful pieces of work, safe in the knowledge it won't be sold but will be enjoyed.

While peacefully protesting the bill, Indigenous peoples were shot with rubber bullets and teargassed.

The media’s role is to inform the public. If they fail to do that, then what is the point?

Some of the shocking recent behaviour of the media: not reporting on major reports and findings on the dire state of our planet and our climate, staying silent on inadequate actions and policies of the government, downplaying how this is going to affect each and everyone of us in only a few years from now.

The people arrived to speak truth to power. And dumped a big load of horse crap right on the door step of the daily Mail among lots more actions through out the day.

❓Did you know there are more than 100 #UncontactedTribes around the world - but the Sentinelese, who live on North Sentinel Island, are probably the most isolated tribe on the planet.

We don’t even know what they call themselves. But we do know that they’re much healthier than neighboring tribes who were forcibly contacted decades ago – many of them have been decimated.

Following a campaign by @survivalinternational and local organizations, the Indian government abandoned plans to contact them. That didn’t stop US missionary John Allen Chau from trying in 2018.

Missionaries continue trying to evangelize uncontacted tribes worldwide.

👉 They’re the most vulnerable peoples on the planet.
👉 They all face catastrophe unless their land is protected.
👉 Whole populations are being wiped out by violence from outsiders who steal their land and resources, and by diseases like the flu and measles to which they have no resistance. 

🏞️ #UncontactedTribes have vast botanical and zoological knowledge and a unique understanding of sustainable living. There’s irrefutable evidence that their territories are the best barrier to deforestation, particularly in the Amazon.

@survivalinternational 
Survival International’s taking over our Instagram today to mark #UncontactedTribesWeek! 🏹🌎

There are more than 100 uncontacted tribes around the world from the Amazon to Indonesia, many of them survivors of past atrocities and massacres. With their rich cultures and unique worldviews, they’re a vital part of human diversity. 

They have vast botanical and zoological knowledge and a unique understanding of sustainable living. There’s irrefutable evidence that their tribal territories are the best barrier to deforestation, particularly in the Amazon rainforest.

If they’re left in peace they thrive, but everywhere they suffer racism, land theft, and genocidal violence just because they live differently.

Since 1969, Survival has led the global campaign for uncontacted tribes’ rights to their lands and livelihoods, and this fight is now more urgent than ever. Please spread the word on social media – look for the #UncontactedTribesWeek hashtag – and take action to let them live! ✊

You can help prevent genocide, put an end to the destruction of uncontacted tribes and their lands, and stop government violence and oppression.

Unioninkadulla nähtiin eilen laulua ja tanssia. Emme ole kuitenkaan täällä vain pitämässä hauskaa. 

Olemme turhautuneita ja väsyneitä. Olemme jatkaneet mielenilmausta nyt yli kolme päivää, eikä vaatimuksiimme ole vastattu.

Vaatimuksemme ovat seuraavat: 

❶ Kerro totuus. 
Hallituksen on julistettava Suomeen ympäristö- ja ilmastohätätila ja ryhdyttävä säännölliseen kriisitiedotukseen.

❷ Toimi nyt. 
Hallituksen on luotava sitova lainsäädäntö hiilineutraaliuden saavuttamiseksi vuoteen 2025 mennessä, ja aloitettava välittömästi laaja ekologinen jälleenrakennus.

❸ Laajennetaan demokratiaa.
Hallituksen on kutsuttava koolle kansalaisista satunnaisotannalla valittu kansalaisfoorumi. Kansalaisfoorumi käy puntaroivia keskusteluja tutkimustiedon pohjalta ja tekee ehdotuksia sosiaalisesti oikeudenmukaisista päästövähennyskohteista ja luonnonsuojelutoimista. Eduskunnan on käsiteltävä foorumin ehdotukset.

They say that flares are only to be released in case of emergency. @xrebellionwa rebels clearly agree! This is a climate and ecological emergency!

APPEA, you’re a criminal cartel. You’re responsible for the extinction of thousands of species and the brutal decimation of our planet. Worse, we know you know this yet continue to put profit before people and planet.

@theoceanrebellion As dawn broke this morning, the first day of the G7 summit in Cornwall, members of Ocean Rebellion staged a powerful theatrical action.  A mass stranding of mermaids, tangled in discarded trawler nets, washed up on a beach near the gathering of G7 heads of state. 

A foghorn dinghy sounded a deafening alarm, awakening the delegates at Tregenna Castle hotel from their apathetic dreams – 5 long blasts, the maritime SOS signal, signalling the imminent death of the oceans if the G7 heads of state fail in their high duty to act.

“Ocean Rebellion demands the G7 puts the ocean at the top of the agenda where it belongs. With fish stocks already 90% depleted, humanity cannot continue industrial fishing. Beam trawling alone emits more carbon than all of global aviation. These environmentally devastating intensive fishing methods must end NOW.  The seas are too valuable to destroy. Destroy them, and we destroy ourselves.  Ocean Rebellion calls for an emergency global ban on bottom trawling, on both biodiversity and climate grounds, by COP26.” - Sophie Miller of Ocean Rebellion

This weekend thousands of activists from many groups are taking to the streets and the beach in Cornwall as the G7 summit takes place. Extinction Rebellion are sounding the alarm on the G7's broken promises on the climate and ecological emergency which are already affecting people in the global south now. We need the world's richest nations to halt biodiversity loss, and rapidly reduce emissions to have any hope of climate justice. G7: Act Now⁣
⁣
Delegates from XR have presented letters from those on the front lines of this emergency to the G7 compound, marched to the G7 media centre, and even brought a boat. But these world leaders, propped up by a corporate media, continue to greenwash and make empty promises as they showboat on the world stage. G7: Tell The Truth⁣
⁣
The G7 is unable to think about major crises, they are part of a political economy obsessed with infinite growth. The leaders of the world's richest nations are stuck in the business as usual mindset. We know we need to change the system to confront this crisis. When you put ordinary citizens, representative of the population, with expert advice, they can redesign the system. We need a citizens' assembly now. G7: Trust The People⁣

Rebels of @theoceanrebellion staged a theatrical action on the shores of the Cornish coastal resort Marazion, with the iconic St Michael’s Mount in the background. 

The action was part of an ongoing series of protests leading up to the G7 summit to be held nearby, featuring Boris Johnson sharing intimate quality-time in Cornwall with an oily Fossil Fuel Buddy. The celebrity pair were seen sitting on deck-chairs as the sun rose and a boat burned in the bay, billowing black smoke, across its sail inscribed ‘Your Children’s Future.’ 

The scene represents the UK government’s total lack of purpose to do anything to combat the catastrophic climate change, ocean acidification and biodiversity loss that will devastate all our futures and leave a dead ocean for future generations. 

@theoceanrebellion say the UK government must make the ocean a priority at the G7 summit, and want politicians to distance themselves from the fossil fuel industry. We demand all governments cease subsidies to shipping and begin to tax shipping fuel. We demand the fleet is furloughed until a full and open investigation of world fish stocks is completed, with all fisher folk to receive full pay using a tax on commercial shipping fuel. 

Countless young people have already decided not to have children because the future they will face is simply too hard. With extreme weather already afflicting many people, crop-yields are failing and food shortages are leading to conflict, forced migration and famine. Our disregard of the Ocean has led to a catastrophic decline in fish stocks, with many crucial habitats totally destroyed. 

The UK government must prioritise genuine action on climate and nature at G7. The time for posturing is over.

Este sábado arrancamos la Rebelión Global #G7 enfrente de la embajada de Canada con un waltz! 💃🏻🕺🏻

En este waltz mostramos la situación de las mineras canadienses en México. Para visibilizar la hipocresía del gobierno de Canada, rumbo a la reunion de líderes del G7 que tendrá lugar en el Reino Unido del 11 al 13 de Junio.

🇲🇽 Un ejemplo importante del saqueo está en la minería: son las compañías mineras canadienses (en oro Goldcorp, Torex Gold, Equinox Gold, Alamos Gold, y Agnico Eagle Mines, y en plata estan Pan American Silver, y Fortuna Silver, entre otras), las cuales en los últimos 15 años han acaparado del 65% al 75% de la inversión extranjera en la minería. De las 10 minas de oro mas grandes de México, 6 son de mineras canadienses. México es por mucho el país con más extracción de plata en el mundo, y uno de los mayores en otros metales como el oro, cobre.

💰Y solo le pagan al gobierno mexicano menos del 1% en impuestos! Goldcorp (con sede en Vancouver), en Sonora pagó 0.04% en impuestos, 3000 veces menos que en Canada. Lo que NO es suficiente para cubrir el daño al medio ambiente, asi como la explotación humana y de recursos naturales. De las mas de 25 mil concesiones mineras en México, solo se hacen 200 visitas al año por parte de las autoridades.

😤Mas de 40 pueblos originarios han sufrido ocupación minera, y cuando protestan los asesinan. A los trabajadores mineros se les paga 8 veces menos que a los canadienses, y la mitad no tienen seguro medico.

💦La minería en México usa 400 millones de metros cúbicos de agua, y en muchos casos en zonas con estrés hídrico ya existente. Aparte de que son contaminados con metales pesados.

Este waltz de la muerte a dejado a las empresas canadienses ricas y al medio ambiente mexicano destruido.

“We XR Hewa Bora being a group of indigenous people in Mugunga camp. Given the current climate situation, a campaign to raise awareness in our area (Mugunga) aimed at bringing to the local population the effects of climate change and its origin. It should be pointed out that the majority of the climate effects are from the production of factories and industries in G7 countries.

We local people gathered together as one, deciding and denouncing the environmental threats regenerated by G7 productions in terms of the environment. Note that these effects are disturbing our cultural season and causing a sharp decline in country production.

Part of the activities of the Global Rebellion # G7 is to demand that member countries honor their environmental debts.

Mexico is being overexploited and polluted by the G7 extractive activities to the point that bodies of water, soils, forests and crops are destroyed, preventing the population from enjoying the benefits of these and causing diseases, poverty, loss of tangible assets among many other conditions.

And that is why today we demand that they effectively mitigate the environmental impact of their companies #LxsEstamosMirando

“On this June 8th, World Ocean Day, we need to warn the world about one of the biggest threats to our seas, in Brazilian territory, which is the 17th round of auctions for oil and gas exploration blocks by the Brazilian National Agency for Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP). At the moment, activists from Arayara International Institue, Extinction Rebellion Brasil and Fridays For Future Brasil are performing artivism, in front of the ANP headquarters, in Rio de Janeiro, to raise awareness about the auction, which affects extremely sensitive areas, such as the National Marine Park Fernando de Noronha, the Environmental Protection Area in its surroundings and the Atol das Rocas Biological Reserve, putting at risk dozens of marine species critically endangered.

Also this week, the leaders of G7 countries – Germany, Canada, the United States, France, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom – will meet in England, for three days, starting on Friday. Activists from the Extinction Rebellion movement and other organizations, in the UK and around the world, are planning responses to this meeting to demand effective action to stop the exploitation of fossil fuels and combat climate change.”

 @xrargentina ¿Cómo hacer llegar nuestro mensaje a las potencias que integran el G7? (english below) 

🎤 Nos sumamos a #PassTheMic o #CedaElMicrófono 

Una iniciativa de @extinctionrebellion y @cop26_extinctionrebellion mediante la cual los XR del norte global ceden sus redes a grupos del sur global.

👁 De esta manera se intenta visibilizar mundialmente cómo los países del G7 afirman ser sustentables y estar comprometidos con la crisis climática, mientras que sus empresas y consumo atentan contra la vida en los países del sur global.

🚲 Ayer hicimos una bicicleteada #AntiG7 donde visitamos todas sus embajadas en Argentina y les dejamos un mensaje. 📸 Documentamos nuestra acción y el video será difundido junto con más información sobre la crisis climática y ecológica en nuestra región.

📣 Para ayudarnos a potenciar nuestra voz nos cederán sus redes: 

🇩🇪🇫🇷🇪🇸🇺🇸🇦🇷

🎤 XR Washington DC (Estados Unidos) @extinctionrebelliondc y XR Valencia (España)  @xrvalencia 

🎤 Mientras Francia, París y Araba  @extinctionrebellionfrance @extinctionrebellionparisy @xr.araba cederán sus redes a @xr.rosario

LAKE VICTORIA IS DYING @xruggreatlakes #G7 #Act Now #Tell the truth.

In the middle of the 18thC,  Britian took the string towards infrastructural development due to the existence of Coal snd Raw materials. However towards the end of the 18thC and the start of the 19thC other European powers joined in and these included Germany,  France,  Italy and others. With the booming of the industral business across Europe which led to the exhaustion of raw materials that where facilitating production. The alternative case was Africa which later led to the 1885 Berlin Conference where african states where shared among the big wigs of Europe. With the invasion of Africa it meant exctraction of raw materials taking them to home countries however others considered settling up the industries in Africa. It must be remembered that industries are very largely known for the contributions toeards carbon emmissions ehich damages the ozone layer nevertheless persistent dumping of industral wastes both on land and in water. For this case Lake Victoria in Uganda the second biggest fresh water lake in the world has particularly been affected by the industral revolution and the wastes are partly responsible for the ultimate death of fish species around Lake Victoria. This is a very big problem. Mother Nature is being washed away by the greedy and everyone is silent. Time to act is now. Lake Victoria is bleeding.

🎤 Pass The Mic: G7 Global Rebellion 🎤 

XR Trees Hoima joins the global action to amplify our voices about the Save Bugoma Forest campaign. 5 sq miles of land part of Bugoma tropical forest were given away to Hoima Sugar for sugar cane growing. Activists together with other environmental conservation organisations sued Hoima Sugar and National Environmental Management Authority, NEMA, in the courts of law for issuing a licence to Hoima Sugar which the activists termed as illegal and unlawful action. The activists lost the case to Hoima Sugar, meaning they will go ahead to clear cut the forest and plant sugar cane which still activists are against it.

“We are calling upon the G7 countries to stop supporting the so called investors of Hoima Sugar in terms of loans and put a total ban of their products to be consumed in their countries.

We are working to support community tree planting by giving them quality indigenous tree seedlings for planting in their degraded farm lands as well as raising awareness of the dangers associated with cutting the forest which include among others, wildlife displacement hence conflicts between communities and wildlife, climate change, desertification, etc.”

¡¡Hoy en el Día del Medio Ambiente arrancamos la Rebelión Global #G7 con el Sonidero Rebelde!! 💃🏻🕺🏻

@xr_youth_mx, @xrchihuahua, @xr_toluca, @xr_mex,  y  @xr_pachuca estamos bailando, pero también estamos recordando la avaricia e hipocresía de los gobiernos y empresas de los países del G7, que lo que no pueden destruir en sus países vienen a destruir a los nuestros, quieren comprar y vender todo, como si la vida tuviese precio.

🗓La reunión de líderes del G7 tendrá lugar en el Reino Unido del 11 al 13 de Junio

😤 Estos países suelen celebrar que en 2015 firmaron el histórico Acuerdo Climático de París para limitar las emisiones globales. Pero la realidad es que ninguna de las naciones del G7 está cumpliendo las promesas que hicieron. 🌎⌛️

💰 Mientras tanto sus empresas vienen a México con promesas de generar prosperidad en el país a través de sus inversiones. Pero la realidad es que están saqueando nuestros recursos, y dejandonos un territorio esteril y contaminado. 

⛏Un ejemplo importante del saqueo y contaminación son las mineras canadienses. 

⛽️Dada la crisis climática, es urgente hacer cambios profundos en nuestra sociedad, economía y gobierno. Ya NO podemos seguir extrayendo petróleo!! Pero las empresas petroleras del G7, siguen impunes destruyendo el planeta. En México tenemos empresas de Estados Unidos, Italia, Reino Unido, Alemania, y Francia. Todas ellas acercándonos cada vez más al punto de no retorno y colapso ambiental. 🌎⌛️

🚗 La gran industria automotriz en México (No. 6 global en 2018) también es muy contaminante, no solo en producción sino también en el uso de los automóviles mismos.  Aquí también empresas del G7 sobresalen, por ejemplo de Alemania, Japón,  Estados Unidos. No podemos seguir produciendo automóviles, y menos de combustión interna. 

Los países del G7 NO están haciendo lo suficiente para limitar el calentamiento global. Por eso les decimos que #LxsEstamosMirando, necesitamos que #HonrenSusDeudasMedioambientales, #ProtejanNuestrxsDefensoresDeLaTierra, porque sus empresas nos están matando y por eso les decimos #DejenDeMatarnos, #SuCodiciaNuestraMuerte.",NA,NA,NA,-6.94

Yesterday on World Environment Day @xr_makassar had a mural party in the city centre where they painted a giant climate emergency mural asking the G7 to act rather than greenwash and to mark the start of ‘resistance month’ for all Indonesian citizens who have been deprived the right of living on a healthy planet. Here’s some words from XR Makassar on the action and G7:

“Through our mural party we offer aspirations and social critics to our stakeholders to act quickly to cope with the climate crisis situation that threatens our survival. 

G7 We are tired of your polished words, bought at a huge expense from your slick think tanks. 

We are exhausted by your twisted plans to carry on as usual, while making yourselves appear the saviour of the planet. We are watching. 

We see G7 corporations destroying livelihoods and destabilising planetary safety nets in countries where you think you’re not seen. But we see you supporting the frackers, the drillers, the loggers, the polluters - all your friends.

We are calling on you G7, to listen, hear us for we are watching you and we will not be silent.”

We stand with you 🙏

The G7 represent the world's richest and most powerful governments who continue to pander to the multinational companies committing environmental crimes in Africa, Latin America and much of Asia. They are in bed together, seeking to maintain profit at the expense of people in the Global South and other MAPA who are the least responsible for the climate crisis.

The poorest 50% of humanity only accounted for 7% of the cumulative emissions between 1990 and 2015 while 10% of the richest accounted for 52%.

Today, XR groups from the global north will give their platforms and media resources to XR groups from places already heavily impacted by climate change. Let's come together and amplify their messages!

“Forests in Sudan are between citizen's axes and troop's tractors. 

So, on 5th June 2021 #WorldEnvironmentDay we cleaned up litter in the Al- Sunut forest, which suffered huge damages from the cutting of trees by government commissioned tractors. We also discussed environmental sanitation and crimes, in addition to desertification, water pollution and raised community awareness to the importance of protecting the earth for the sake of future generations.”

Our Letter to the G7: 

“Dear G7,

We, Extinction Rebellion groups in the global south, are asking members of the G7 to make decisions that embody human rights for all.

We ask that you be exemplary leaders globally and not only on your own territory. We ask that you stop what is happening in the global south which is being devastated by companies and consumption from the global north. 

This catastrophic destruction of climate and ecology is costing us our livelihoods and our lives. How many of us will be forced to leave our lands through water scarcity, soil degradation, pollution, fires, extreme weather events and sea level rise?

We ask that you restore and preserve existing spaces not only in the global north, but also in the global south. Right now, we see that the companies of the G7 are doing the opposite of this. 

We ask for a Paris Agreement for everyone. We hold you accountable. Your preservation is our preservation and our preservation is your preservation. 

Specifically, we say this: 
G7- We are watching you
G7 – We are tired of your polished words, bought at huge expenses elsewhere”

Como você sabe, nos últimos anos os biomas brasileiros vem sendo cada vez mais ameaçados e destruídos como consequência de empresas que visam apenas o lucro e ações do governo atual.

Hi, my name is Gabi and I am a part of Extinction Rebellion Brazil, and today I would like to ask for a few seconds of your time. As you probably know, throughout the past few years several Brazilian biomes are being threatened by companies who only seek profit and our current government's actions. Being so, I would like to ask that you start consuming products more consciously, researching the companies you defend and boycotting those that are aggravating global warming, invading indigenous lands, and destroying the environment.

“Made up in black and white with red on their hearts, our performers appealed to the local, national and international community representing the seriousness and the danger posed by environmental issues in the southern country. They are calling on anyone concerned about the environment to march  and to come to the aid and to ensure a good protection to the defenders of the environment at the local, national and international level.

The colors black and white represent the uniqueness of environmental advocates. The red on the heart means that in the four corners of the world several defenders of the environment are arrested, tortured, kidnapped and sometimes killed for showing the world what the big polluters (G7) are doing to the world and  humanity through industries, mining, fossil fuels ...

XR SAKE calls on the G7 to consider the dangers they pose to humanity and calls on them to stop intimidating environmental activists in their countries and around the world.

We call on all environmental activists in the Extinction Rebellion Network to come together as one to face this mediocrity and hypocrisy of the G7 countries.”

MV X-Press Pearl, a Singapore-flagged container ship leaking acid and plastic pellets into the Indian Ocean around Sri Lanka, has begun to sink after burning for over two weeks near Colombo harbor. The vessel with a container leaking nitric acid reported smoke from the cargo on the 20th May and fire on deck on 21st May. 🔥🚢

The island's maritime regulations regarding these incidents are quite weak. Overlapping mandates of different government organizations, legal loopholes are yet to be fixed even though this is the third maritime adversary experienced by the country. On 28th May, Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) revealed in a press release that on 19th May, when MV X-PressPearl contacted SLPA to inform that it would arrive in the waters of the Port of Colombo at mid-night, SLPA had not been informed of any chemical leakage on board the vessel. ⚖️

It is estimated at least 3 containers full of nurdles (plastic pellets) have fallen into the ocean during the fire, which roughly calculates up to 3,975,000,000 nurdles which are now destroying marine life and corals. A substantial proportion of the ship's cargo is fuel, acid, and other toxic contaminants, which will be released into the ocean as the ship sinks. Any fuel and lube oil petroleum leak from the vessel will further worsen the damage caused by plastic nurdles and chemicals that fell into the ocean. ☣️💀

The public is already witnessing dead marine animals being washed ashore that have swallowed plastic pallets or toxins now dissolved in the ocean. ⏳

This is the worst environmental disaster in Sri Lanka's history and will affect the island for centuries to come. As the owners of the vessel MV X-PressPearl, the Singapore-based company @xpressfeeders should take responsibility for this destruction and compensate for the destruction it caused to our marine ecosystem as well as for the destroyed livelihoods of Sri Lankan fishing communities. 🗣️

@shell we see your climate crimes. We see your human rights abuses and have not forgotten what you did in the Niger Delta. We see your funding for companies that lobby against fossil fuel regulation. We see that you knew about the climate crisis for decades, but chose to cover it up rather than raise the alarm and take action.

@sciencemuseum we know that arts and culture are criminally underfunded but this is not the way. By accepting Shell's money you are helping them look like a friendly, helpful company, and in so doing, avoid regulation.

To our followers, if you agree that Shell should NOT be sponsoring an exhibition about our future planet please write to Sir Ian Blatchford and tell him so:

The per capita consumption footprint of the richest 10% is more

30 times higher than the poorest 50%
The G7 carbon-intensive economies are consuming too much and
it is destroying everyone’s basic needs. But it is especially
affecting basic needs in countries that did least to cause climate

agriculture and dangerously diminished by climate change. Our
soil is depleted. Our forests cut and burned. Our food systems
destabilised by climate change. Our lands flooded and lost to

the centre of its impact. Your greed: our death.

A green washing machine is part of a creative blockade of Peterhead power station this morning with four rebels locked-on.

20 rebels from Extinction Rebellion Scotland and Glasgow Calls Out Polluters blocked the entrance to the SSE gas power station in Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, preventing vehicle access to the site, with four activists locked-on to a green-painted washing machine and two red gas canisters. 

The group’s banner says ‘Clean Gas is a Dirty Lie’ and hung green clothes on a washing line, which includes slogans like ‘COP26: Stop the Greenwash’ and ‘Climate Inaction Kills’.

Greenwashing” is when a company pays to advertise themselves as friends of the environment, while continuing to cause ecological destruction.

The UK Government have taken money from SSE to sponsor the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow this November while the company run Scotland’s most polluting power station. 

We are also calling for a “Just Transition” away from a fossil fuel based economy that does not abandon those who would be most affected by that shift.

När bina tystnar var en konstperformance för att uppmärksamma att vi befinner oss i början på den sjätte massutrotningen – en utrotning som vi som människor har åsamkat, och med en uppmaning till regeringen att kriminalisera ekocid. En miljon arter hotas av utrotning inom de närmsta decennierna. Så mycket som tre fjärdedelar av alla arter på jorden riskerar att försvinna under de närmaste århundradena om vi inte agerar nu. Flera studier visar också på en skrämmande nedgång i insektspopulationer - faktum är att 40 procent av alla insektsarter hotas av utrotning. I Sverige står redan 30 procent av alla bi- och humlearter med på Artdatabankens rödlista - de är alltså på väg att försvinna. Insekter är livsviktiga som föda för djur och som pollinatörer. Minst 75 procent av globala grödor är i någon utsträckning beroende av pollinatörer. Insektsdöden leder alltså till matbrist och svält och i förlängningen att människor dör. Det ligger således ett djupt allvar bakom titeln på vår aktion - utan naturen överlever vi inte.

Aktionen inleddes 12.30 på Sergels torg med att vi ramade in torget med banners, och började montera en giraff i naturlig storlek. Efter det följde en flashmob av blodindränkta rebeller.

Rebellerna som deltog i aktionen var mycket stillsamma, värdiga och tysta. Folk stannade upp och tittade. Vissa kom fram till de blodindränkta rebellerna och pratade. Efter ett tag kom polisen, och vissa rebeller som inte ville lyda blev bortburna.

Media skrev om oss. För länkar till artiklar, se linktree på vår profil.

Passa på att fira nu alla, XR-rebeller! Det här var en fantastisk aktion och sättet vi kunde genomföra aktionen på, budskapet vi förmedlade, allt folk och media som nåddes av vårt budskap, konstens kraft och styrkan i gemenskapen och samarbetet - det känns och är en seger. Njut och fira. Vi tar nya tag snart igen. ✨✨✨

Die Klimakrise ist die größte Herausforderung des 21. Jahrhunderts. Deshalb ist es höchste Zeit, dass sich diese Tatsache angemessen in den Medien widerspiegelt. Mit bundesweiten Aktionen vor Redaktionen und Rundfunkanstalten wiesen wir die Medien heute auf ihre besondere Verantwortung für umfangreiche Berichterstattung hin.

Bereits am frühen Morgen enthüllten Menschen in Leipzig ein Denkmal aus Eis vor dem MDR mit der Aufschrift: ""27.5.2021 // 419 ppm CO2 // Wir werden nicht sagen können, wir hätten nicht gewusst, was zu tun war"". Nach der Aktion erhielten sie eine Einladung zum Gespräch mit dem MDR. Nach einem bunten Protest vor dem SWR Studio in Stuttgart wurden wir ebenfalls zu Gesprächen eingeladen.

In Hamburg begann vor dem Verlagshaus Gruner + Jahr eine Demonstration, die im weiteren Verlauf an den Redaktionen von SPIEGEL, ZDF, Bauer Media Group und ZEIT vorbeiführte. Bei Bauer Media Group klebten sich Menschen an die Scheiben, um ihrem Protest Nachdruck zu verleihen. Auch in Düsseldorf wurden Medienhäuser besucht, umgeben von großem Polizeiaufgebot.

In München befestigten sich mehrere mit Sekundenkleber und Eisenketten im Foyer der Sendezentrale des Bayerischen Rundfunks, um die Verantwortlichen der Sendeanstalt zu einer besseren Berichterstattung über die Klima- und Umweltkrise aufzufordern. Sie sendeten eine eigene Nachrichtensendung namens ""GlueOn TV"" aus dem Foyer des BR live im Internet. Weitere Unterstützer*innen besetzten den Vorplatz des Funkhauses und stellten eine Talkshow nach.

Dass sich @das_erste heute dazu entschlossen hat, #SprücheVor8 statt @KlimaVor8 einzuführen, verdeutlicht, warum wir weiter protestieren müssen. Wir fordern, dass die Medien ihre Berichterstattung konsequent an der Klima- und ökologischen Krise ausrichten und in jedem Ressort mitdenken sollen. Die Dramatik erfordert eine breite Aufklärungskampagne über die beiden in Verbindung stehenden Krisen. Auch darf das Problem nicht durch verharmlosende Begriffe wie ""Klimawandel"" heruntergespielt werden. Denn wir befinden uns in einer globalen Katastrophe!

These pellets will absorb surrounding chemicals and toxins with time making them even more dangerous. ⚠️🐟

@oceanswellorg reports that there is also a possibility of acid rain due to the nitric oxide and nitric dioxide (NO and NO2) produced in the combustion of the vessel's chemicals. However, if the concentration remains low, the potential acid rain would likely produce less worrying results. 🌧️

They further state that the chemicals onboard the vessel such as nitric acid, caustic soda, solid sodium methoxide, cosmetics, methanol, and vinyl acetate will likely have local impacts and dissipate. However, the oil spill from the vessel remains a bigger concern. 🛢️

Year after year, declaration after declaration, multilateral institutions - including the World Health Organisation (WHO) - have warned us: climate change and the loss of biodiversity endanger human health worldwide.

""Climate change is the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century"" WHO

Global warming is an existential threat for future generations. More than a threat, it is in fact already a reality. As frontline health workers, we are confronted every day with the consequences of environmental deterioration on our patients and communities. The list of ailments they suffer from is getting longer every day. We are seeing more and more respiratory and cardio-vascular diseases due to polluted air, loss of working days and deaths due to heat waves, over and undernutrition due to lack of quality food, and diarrhoea and intoxications due to polluted drinking water.

Despite accumulating evidence, repeated warnings from numerous organisations and successive international conferences, worrisome indicators from monitoring tools and successive assessments, despite more frequent and more serious natural disasters, including the COVID-19 pandemic - probably heralding the emergence of new health disasters - the concrete actions implemented by our governments are not nearly enough considering the severity and urgency of the situation.

Faced with inertia, inaction and the abyssal distance between speeches and actions, we, the signatories, who witness every day the deterioration of the health of our patients and communities due to climate change and environmental degradation, demand: That health authorities in every country publicly state that climate change is putting people at risk of death, and act now to preserve life.

On 21st May 2021, Activists from China, France and Switzerland started a indefinite hunger strike against ecocide. Demanding a acquittal to all the Zadists. 

In the Grève pour l'Avenir (Strike For Future) demonstrations, there were 4000 activists demanding immediate action on the climate and ecological emergency. Musicians and XR dancing rebels, XR Citizen Assembly, XR Doctors all greeted the hunger strikers in Saint Laurent. 

They held their boards high for people to see, and swam through the the crowds to share their flyers to invite people to bring their sleeping bags and join them. 

Later on, they wrote speeches in a rush. Robin repeated his speech about his story of repression.

Howey read her speech as a poem, about the eviction and brave zadists defending the hill of the Mormont. 

“The goddess of justice is upset. Children who want to protect their future are put in jail and fined, while multinationals like Lafarge/Holcim continue to dig up mountains and threaten fragile ecosystems.""
- Howey

“We are the sacrificed generation, the last one who can change everything. We are applauded when we talk about changes, but when as try to build the future we want, we are arrested, we are gassed, we are hit.""
- Robin 

As a normal stranger on the streets, they have exposed their vulnerabilities to the public, because they trust the connection and love to the earth and all beings. So they set themselves in the harms way to create a bridge to connect with everyone.

For a long time, the ocean has been our greatest friend. It has helped us to survive, explore, and connect with one another over many thousands of years.

We owe our lives and many of the privileges we enjoy today to our relationship with the sea. But deep trenches have formed in this relationship that are manifesting in terrifying ways – and our species is entirely to blame. Since the dawn of the industrial revolution, humans have exploited both land and sea at ever-increasing rates for profit and power and our planet has become warmer and warmer as a result. 

Now our actions have transformed the ocean into a formidable foe: sea levels are rising faster than at any other point in recorded history and these swelling tides threaten to swallow up the land that many of us call home. It is now clear that this observable threat will have consequences never before seen in human history, some of which might just surprise you.

On Sunday, @xrlambeth rebels paid a visit to the UK Science Museum’s Our Future Planet exhibition to highlight Shell’s attempt at cleaning up their well-deserved reputation of worst climate offenders by sponsoring this exhibition.

The Science Museum has inspired generations of children and adults with a love of the natural world. Now more than ever, we need an inspiring and ethical vision of the future. We need our Museums to tell beautiful and powerful stories with integrity.

“The utter failure of governments and corporate interests to reverse destructive impacts on the planet’s survival systems threatens our civilisation and much of life on Earth. Shell continues to play a key role in the escalating crisis, but they are clear that their business depends on a societal licence to operate, Funding exhibitions allows Shell to borrow the prestige and implied endorsement of the Science Museum Group.

So why on earth is their exhibition on the climate emergency ‘Our Future Planet’ sponsored by Shell? 

The management of the Science Museum is not listening to the youth, the scientists, the public or even their own staff who all want the Museum to cut financial ties with fossil fuel companies.”

- Scientists for Extinction Rebellion

Demand 1: Tell The Truth 
We demand that the Science Museum Group immediately declare a climate and ecological emergency and reconsider its role in society accordingly. 

Demand 2: Act Now
We demand that the Science Museum Group cut financial ties with all fossil fuel companies and publicly denounce their persistent mischaracterisation of the science of climate change in the strongest possible terms.

The Fairy Creek blockade has been going for months to prevent the logging of some of the last old-growth forests on Vancouver Island. 

✳️We must stand against the destruction that our government is allowing in the name of corporate greed. 

‼️There’s over 5 km of road-building approved into the Greater Fairy Creek Rainforest, including into the headwaters of the intact valley known as “Cloud Forest,” which is home to some of the oldest yellow cedar trees in Canada. ‼️

✳️The Fairy Creek blockade is the LAST STAND to protect these forests.

‼️The BC Supreme Court granted an injunction against the blockades earlier this year and activists are expecting RCMP enforcement. Since they don’t plan on backing down, arrests are likely.

The protest, organized by a coalition of activist groups including @pollutersout @shalemustfall @bpnotbp @fossilfreelondon @cop26_extinctionrebellion and @frackofflondon called out BP for its misleading claims on the climate emergency. 

 ‼️The oil giant has already faced a significant backlash over its stated ambition to reach ‘net zero’ greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, which campaigners claim is full of loopholes, allows the continued destruction of frontline communities around the world, and is TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE for the climate. ‼️

‼️Mariafernanda Duran, one of the organizers of the action, said: 

""BP’s ‘Net Zero by 2050’ ambition is deceptive and no amount of greenwashing can hide the fact their extractivist practices in the Global South. With their current plans, they have prioritized profit over life. BP should not be investing $9 billion this year in fossil fuels, or planning to still be drilling in 2050. We call on BP to phase out their fossil fuel business entirely, in line with climate science.”‼️

👉🏽👉🏾👉🏼Despite research showing that the world can't even afford to burn existing fossil fuel reserves BP continues to push ahead with major new extractive projects in Argentina, Australia, and the Russian Arctic. 

There was a large number of police in attendance, but they did not actively interfere with the performance.

The protest was carried out in as COVID-safe a way as possible, with participants wearing masks and socially distancing. Today’s action is part of a new wave of climate protest that is likely to emerge as lockdown eases in the UK.

⁣
This Eid we are sharing @xrmuslims statement on Sheikh Jarrah:⁣
⁣
What is #SaveSheikhJarrah? Sheikh Jarrah is a predominantly Palestinian neighbourhood in East Jerusalem, 2 km north of the Old City. 28 Palestinian families currently face the threat of forceful eviction, many already previously illegally evicted from Talbiya in 1948. ⁣
⁣
Forced removal of an occupied people is illegal under international law and Israel’s claim for Jerusalem remains disputed by the UN Partition Resolution. Palestinians continue being forcibly displaced to make way for Israeli settlers to take their homes. ⁣
⁣
Last month, Human Rights Watch released a statement declaring Israeli authorities of being guilty of apartheid against Palestinians. This Monday, Israeli police violently stormed Al-Aqsa mosque and attacked Palestinians worshipping during Ramadan. ⁣
⁣
Following the facts and XR principle #4, we openly challenge this deeply unjust, toxic system. XR Muslims stand in solidarity with the Palestinians. We urge everyone around us to call out on Israel’s illegal settlements and continued human rights violations.⁣
⁣
We invite our global community to share these statements far and wide, and to continue to share the words, names, images and stories of Palestinians worldwide to mitigate their erasure.⁣

No banners, no decorating bridges, buildings or blockades today, but one smack in front of the headquarters of Robeco. 

Tuesday the 18th of May Shell will be presenting its ‘’energy-transition’’ plan in a general meeting. While there is a dire need for substantial transformation of the energy-sector, Shell packages yet more oil production and a doubling of gas production up to 2030 in some flashy greenwashing. This transition plan is really just an extinction plan. 

Shareholders, such as Robeco, have the power to reject the proposal, and demand Shell to be truly ‘future-proof’ and commit to actual transition instead of a masked continuation of current practices. This is exactly why we’re calling upon Robeco today to invest in our collective future, and reject #ShellsExtinctionPlan.

Demand accountability from Shell's shareholders  yourself by signing the petition in our bio.

Extinction Rebellion Australia stands in solidarity with the French Citizens Convention for Climate!⁣
⁣
French president @EmmanuelMacron is greenwashing and trashing his government’s response to the climate emergency 🚨⁣
⁣
The French Citizens Convention for Climate was initiated by the French government in response to the Yellow Vest / #GiletJaune protests. The body deliberated and proposed measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and implement climate justice. Macron’s government took it upon itself to water down the proposals or reject them entirely.⁣

This crowdfunder (link in bio) aims to enable Global South voices to take centre stage during G7 action so their voices are heard. 

Global South XR groups have a lot to say, obviously! Climate and ecological breakdown is affecting them terribly. Yet they are least responsible for the climate crisis, and have the least resources to mitigate.

One obstacle to being heard is a lack of social media infrastructure. This crowdfunder will: 

1. Provide funds to support the development of a thriving social media network in XR groups in the Global South. 

2. Create powerful social media campaigns and highlight attention-grabbing actions.

Each local XR group that is funded will receive €50 towards internet data costs and €200 to purchase a smartphone.

Training in social media use and campaigns will also be provided.

The actions aim to: 

1. Expose the hypocrisy of the G7 countries who signed the Paris Agreement, and yet continue to allow companies from their lands to heat the planet, and commit ecocide in the Global South.

2. Remind the countries in the G7 that they are hugely responsibility for the climate crisis we are in and need to pay climate debt, loss and damages for past destruction, lead the drive to decarbonise our societies and stop biodiversity loss.

It is time activists in the Global North stopped speaking on behalf of the Global South, and instead empowered activists and listened to what they have to say.

✳️An all female group of XR Scotland rebels blocked Faslane’s North Gate to demand a ‘Safe, Green Future’, as part of the International Peace Lotus Campaign. 

👉🏼Climate activists from Extinction Rebellion Scotland, alongside veteran peace activists Trident Ploughshares, have blocked the North gate of the Faslane Naval Base in Gare Loch, home of the UK’s nuclear submarines. 

👉🏼The group placed three planters on the road containing plants and flowers painted with the words ‘Safe’, ‘Green’, and ‘Future’. A female Rebel locked onto each planter so that they cannot be moved, preventing access to the base.

👉🏽👉🏼👉🏿Emergency vehicles could still access the site via the South gate. The group took precautions for COVID-19 including social distancing and face masks.

✳️The action is part of the Peace Lotus campaign, a global day of anti-war resistance coordinated celebrating the anniversary of the end of the Vietnam war. 

As the ongoing Climate and Ecological Emergency  threatens people and the planet, we must come together to build a safe, more just future for all people.

Thousands of people throughout Colombia came out to protest in the streets against the tax reform presented by Alberto Carrasquilla, former Minister of Finance.
 
The articles of the tax reform intended to increase and add taxes to products and servicies of basic necessities, public transportation, social investment projects, clean energy such as wind and sun energy, among others.
 
The national government’s response to the protest and to the disagreement of thousands of Colombians was violence and total repression.

From April 28, 2021 to May 4, 2021, there are 1.443 cases of violence committed by the public force (military and police) occurred at national level.

216 victims of physical violence, 31 victims of homicidal violence, 814 arbitrary arrests against protesters, 239 violent interventions in the framework of peaceful protests, 21 victims of eye attacks, 77 cases of firearms shooting, 10 victims of sexual violence.(NGO Temblores, 2021).

We condemn and reject the violent response of the Public Force and the Colombian State to social protest.

Help us to denounce this outrage against our life. We invite you to protest for all lives.

Rebels Rose and James were arrested in July last year for dying Trafalgar Square fountains red to symbolise the destruction the UK Government was inflicting on our plant and animals. The judge ruled that there was no evidence that any lasting damage had been caused and the charges have now been dropped. 

To paraphrase what the judge said in court to the prosecution ""I'm sure there are much better things you can spend your time on prosecuting instead of these protesters"". 

This ruling comes just weeks after six Extinction Rebellion rebels were cleared by a jury of causing criminal damage to Shell’s London headquarters, despite a judge saying they had ‘no defence in law’. 

Simon Bramwell (one of the six rebels) said: “This is such a significant victory for the consciousness of the British people when it comes to the huge, immediate threat of climate change and the absolute failure of our Government to do anything meaningful about it.”

⁣
At 11am on Saturday 1st May 2021, two years to the day since the UK Parliament declared an environment and climate emergency, over 200 hundred people sat alone blocking roads in a courageous act of protest. 

Rebellion Of One⁣
⁣
The individual disruptive actions took across the UK – including in Scarborough, Weymouth, Birmingham, Oxford, Bradford, Ipswich, Lincoln, Canterbury, Newcastle, Portishead, London, Newquay, Swansea, Bangor in Northern Ireland and many more. This is a Climate Emergency⁣
⁣
This vulnerable act of peaceful civil disobedience by ordinary people across the UK - including doctors, nurses, teachers, students, parents and grandparents - highlighted the fear and frustration felt by many at the failure of the UK Government to take the climate and ecological crisis seriously. 

Governments Must Act Now⁣
⁣
“People may wonder what a nurse is doing sitting in the road with a placard. They may wonder what impact this will have on my career or whether I’ll get in trouble with the police. I am aware of the risks but I feel I have a moral duty to warn people about the catastrophic consequences of the climate crisis. We all witnessed how poorly the UK Government has managed the COVID-19 crisis. There isn't a plan in place to tackle the climate crisis. We cannot let this happen⁣.
 ⁣
We can still change things, we can demand the government acts now. What will our legacy be for future generations? Will it be apathy while witnessing how political greed destroys this planet? Or will it be action, actively fighting to build a safe world that children can live in?"" 

- Andrea Muntiu, NHS Nurse, Ipswitch⁣

✳️Today marks the start of the 2021 National Week of Action for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.

✳️As awareness for the #MMIWG2ST crisis grows, and as natural gas and oil industries continue to build pipelines in North America, it is important now more than ever to amplify the voices of those most impacted: the Indigenous people from communities most vulnerable to contaminated soil & water, and dangerous man camps.

✳️Limited data exists due to the ongoing invisibility and dehumanization of Native peoples, but the information that does exist is alarming.

Activists from the Forest Rebellion and Extinction Rebellion blocked Sveaskog's devastation machines at Sapmi villages near Ängeså and Tärendö.

The forest that Sveaskog plans to cut down is one of Sweden's last natural forests and also a Sapmi cultural relic. The time when nature and people are treated in this way should be long gone.

Vår förtvivlan och sorg över SEB:s investeringar i oljeindustrin är ofantlig. Men vi känner också vrede. Förbränning och borrning efter olja förgör och dödar liv på jorden. 

Idag, den 22 april 2021, genomförde XR Skåne en aktion mot SEB i Västra hamnen, Malmö. SEB är den bank, bland storbankerna, i Sverige som allra mest påskyndar klimatkatastrofen. Sedan Parisavtalet har SEB investerat 158 miljarder i fossilindustrin. Nyligen investerade SEB ytterligare 33.8 miljarder i oljeutvinning i Arktis – ett av världens mest sårbara ekosystem.

På SEB:s egna hemsida kan vi läsa följande: ”SEB har en stark ambition att bidra till hållbar utveckling och vi är fast beslutna att stödja våra kunder i omställningen till en koldioxidsnål ekonomi”.

Men detta rimmar dåligt med sanningen eftersom SEB använder en mängd kryphål för att fortsätta sina investeringar i fossilindustrin. Vi blir grundlurade och banken använder våra pengar, som blir till smutsiga oljepengar, i jakten på evig tillväxt.

VAD KAN DU GÖRA?

BYT BANK. Gå på Fair Finance guide https://fairfinanceguide.se/banks/byt-bank/

MAILA DIN BANK. Kräv att de omedelbart slutar med fossila investeringar.

AGERA. Gå med i Extinction Rebellion och bli en del av kampen.

Rebels in Argentina are raising awareness towards GMO soy.

Genetically modified soybean cultivation does not solve the problem of hunger and destroys biodiversity. 

Each year, more than 17 million hectares of transgenic soy are sown in Argentina. This crop requires over 200 million litres of glyphosate, a poison currently found in our food. 

Pesticides cause spontaneous abortions, malformations, cancer and other pathologies in the exposed population. Those who suffer the most are the fumigators, which puts their lives and their families at risk.

So far, more than 6.5 million hectares of native forest were lost due to this crop. The native forest absorbs 10 times more rainwater than a soybean crop, thus preventing floods.

Besides, soy monoculture has displaced hundreds of communities and has put thousands of families out of work. 

Growing food for humans generates 38 times more jobs than growing food for industrialized animals.

We must transition to agroecology, a system that produces healthy food!

We must demand food sovereignty for our peoples!

Act now. Talk about this!

XR families and others gathered outside the Canadian Embassy in London to call on Canada and the G7 to halt petroleum exploration in the watershed of the Okavango Delta.

The Okavango Delta is a UNESCO world heritage site and home to the largest populations of wildlife remaining in Africa. 

Canadian company ReconAfrica estimates the area contains so much oil and gas that, if burnt, it would consume one sixth of the world's remaining carbon budget.

Wednesday 21st April 2021, three women from Extinction Rebellion glued themselves to the glass windows of NBC’s @TodayShow while live on air. The protestors placed signs on the windows of the show reading “Declare Climate & Ecological Emergency” and “Dear Media, Tell the Truth About The Crisis.”⁣
⁣
This action was in protest of the network’s failure to adequately report on the climate and ecological emergency. ⁣
⁣
Although NBC’s Today Show outperforms it’s morning news program counterparts, climate coverage as a whole made up only 0.4% of overall coverage on corporate broadcast morning, nightly and Sunday morning news shows in 2020. ⁣

The women acted knowing a growing number of women worldwide are becoming increasingly frustrated and fearful for the future of the planet, their own lives and their children. ⁣

It will fail tribal peoples and all humanity, and will destroy millions of lives. It’ll remove the best guardians of nature from the very areas that need protecting.

We asked Oscar-winner Mark Rylance to read from a UNDP report that details the human rights abuses committed by WWF-funded park rangers against the Baka people in the Messok Dja national park in the Congo Basin.
 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
These abuses are common in many protected areas in Africa & Asia. Conservation NGOs like @WWF and @TheWCS support the theft of #indigenous peoples’ lands. The rangers they fund routinely beat, imprison, and sometimes kill them.
 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Conservation NGOs have known about this for many years. Others are aware of the abuse, but remain silent to protect their careers and funding. Their silence is complicity – it allows the atrocities to continue.
 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
If we want to change conservation, environmental & human rights NGOs must speak out, and so must we - for tribes, for nature, for all humanity.

Survival International x Extinction Rebellion 

Survival International will be taking over our Instagram for Earth Day. 🌎

From the Amazon to the Kalahari, from the jungles of India to the Congo rainforest, Survival International work in partnership with tribal peoples to protect their lives and land. They suffer racism, land theft, forced development and genocidal violence just because they live differently. It must stop.

They fight for tribal peoples’ survival. They stop loggers, miners, and oil companies from destroying tribal lands, lives and livelihoods across the globe. They lobby governments to recognize indigenous land rights. They document and expose the atrocities committed against tribal peoples in the name of conservation and campaign to stop them.

They give tribal peoples a platform to speak to the world. They’ve had over 200 victories since 1969, but their work is far from over and they need your help.

You can help prevent genocide, put an end to logging and mining on tribal lands, and stop government violence and oppression.

⁣
The protest started at Blackrock, where youth climate activist Xiye Bastida held a Blackrock CEO Larry Fink impersonator accountable for his company's continued funding of the climate crisis. ⁣
⁣
@Blackrock owns $9 TRILLION in assets, including $1.2 Billion in @Enbridge- the company building Line 3. If that wasn’t bad enough, they have $75 Billion invested in the top 30 tar sands companies. ⁣

They have the financial power to single handedly shift the direction of Wall St towards more sustainable investments, including moving quickly away from some of the dirtiest fossil fuel projects like tar sands. ⁣
⁣
Start by pulling the plug on Line 3! ⁣
⁣
#AllEyesOnBlackrock⁣
⁣
The second part of the action had the groups marching to @JPMorgan @Chase - the #1 banker of climate chaos and a major funder for the Line 3 pipeline. ⁣
⁣
Rebels locked down the construction site of their new multi billion dollar HQ for over an hour. As the largest bank on Wall St, CEO Jamie Dimon has shown little willingness to stop the suicidal profits from fossil fuels that are destroying our communities and our planet. ⁣
⁣
Stay tuned for more information on the #DefundLine3 - Global Day of Action coming up May 7th. DM @xr_nyc if you want to get involved.

👉🏽 The highest levels of biodiversity are found on the lands of Indigenous peoples. This shows that with their knowledge created over millennia, they are the best conservationists, if left alone by industrial activities.💯

The Western know-it-all attitude prevails in conservation,  a direct form of colonial thinking. 

The needs of the local people and their traditional relationships with the natural world are ignored in view of  scientific conservation goals and so called western ""experts"". 

‼️The local people, however, are the ones who will lose their homes and livelihoods through protected areas without having a voice – an obvious form of racism.‼️

How can we kick racism out of conservation?

The fate of Amazonia and its guardians is linked to our own future: Europe must stop its double dealing and act immediately! 

👉🏾 Join us and sign the petition - link in bio. 

To address the absolute emergency in which Amazonia finds itself, indigenous leaders from Brazil, young people mobilized for the climate and more than 70 associations from Europe and the American continent are joining forces to call for, among other things:

1. The creation of a coalition of European parliamentarians

2. The cancellation of the EU-Mercosur free trade agreement

3. The immediate freeze of imports linked to deforestation

All free trade deals speed up the destruction of our Mother Earth by making extractivism cheaper and less regulated. They give corporations even further rights to exploit people and ecosystems, without governments being able to protect them: companies can sue governments under the deal whenever their environmental, labour and health regulations interfere with their profits

Free trade deals throw small farmers into full competition with agro-industry, destroying their livelihoods. They break local and regional markets and ship products around the globe following profit, when they could be made locally. They expand industrial activity and in doing so dispossess local communities of their lands, furthering the historical process of colonisation. 

This trade deal is one of many we must stand against. 

The UK government is also negotiating a free trade deal with Bolsonaro https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/uk-brexit-trade-deal-brazil-amazon-labour-a9077926.html 

We must remain vigilant to ensure that the survival and flourishing of communities and ecosystems are always placed above profit!

@extinctionrebellion_hamburg blockierte zusammen mit 60 Rebellen aus Norddeutschland einen zentralen Abschnitt der Willy-Brand-Straße. Die Straße ist eine der Hauptverkehrsadern in der Hamburger Innenstadt.

Auf der 6-spurigen Straße befestigten sich Menschen in alle Richtungen an einer Betonbadewanne als Ankerpunkt. Überall tanzten, malten und genossen die Menschen die autofreie Zone.

Viele interessierte Leute hielten an, schlossen sich ihnen an und einige blieben sogar bis zum Ende.

April sees a wave of actions happening across the UK and the world - including Brussels, Paris and Melbourne - targeting the financial system and private and central banks in particular.

This wave of actions by XR’s Money Rebellion is designed to expose the role of banks in the climate and ecological crisis. The world's 60 largest banks have funded the fossil fuel industry to the tune of $3.8 trillion since 2016.

The actions in this live-stream highlight the Bank of England's failure to regulate these banks and points to the fact that it still holds investments consistent with 3.5C of warming by the end of the century.

🎥 WATCH: LINK IN BIO

What drives this suicidal inaction is our economic system. Addicted to infinite GDP growth and ever-increasing profits for the rich, this system requires more burning of fossil fuels, more resource extraction, more deforestation and more consumption. The multiple crises that we face - climate change, inequality, overconsumption of the planet's resources - cannot be addressed without changing the system that drives them.

This was live-streamed by the XR Live Streaming team whose mission is to Tell the Truth and spread the news that mainstream media is failing to do.

Capitalism can only sustain itself if it grows constantly. In the past years nature conservation became another new frontier to be exploited. The most powerful parts of the world extract resources and cheap labour from the weaker parts, effectively stealing from them. 

‼️Climate action should also mean climate justice.‼️

It's not enough to resist the systems that destroy our planet. To build something new, let's look at the diverse alternatives in theory and especially in practice. They give life to systemic change!

⁣
The more @NewsCorpAus lies, the sooner our planet dies! 💀🌏🥀⁣
⁣
Rebels here and around the world are mobilising against Rupert Murdoch! We won’t retreat until his empire TELLS THE TRUTH. ⁣
⁣
Yesterday, rebels descended on #NewsCorpse HQ in Naarm/Melbourne with our three Murdoch-specific demands. ⁣
⁣
NewsCorp must:⁣
⁣
1. #TellTheTruth and report in every outlet that the planet is experiencing a human-caused climate and ecological emergency.⁣
⁣
2. Stop providing a platform for climate deniers.⁣
⁣
3. Join the Covering Climate Now initiative, which exists to address the urgent need for better climate coverage.⁣
⁣
For decades the Murdoch media empire has fed the public a constant stream of lies and climate denialism. Masquerading as journalism, the Murdochracy’s sustained campaign of disinformation is specifically designed to support climate-denying politicians and the power elite in the fossil fuel industry.⁣
⁣
In 2011, Prof. Robert Manne published research revealing that for every column published in @The.Australian newspaper accepting the need to act on climate, four were run attacking it. Since then the Murdochracy’s coverage of the climate crisis has worsened.⁣
⁣
In March 2020, Monash University found that NewsCorp publications represented 59% of all climate denialist discussion in Australia. It also revealed that 84% of articles criticising @schoolstrikeforclimate and Extinction Rebellion protestors came from NewsCorp.⁣
⁣
@xrvic_aus’s Murdoch affinity group say:
⁣
“The Murdoch empire and their well documented history of highly orchestrated propaganda, deception, and lies has had a devastating impact on the climate and ecological debate here and overseas. It’s high time they learned some journalistic ethics and told the truth.”⁣

Brazilian rebels flyposted front of agencies with the messages:
""Banks suffocate human rights""
""Your money finances deforestation, death and invasion of indigenous lands""
""These banks [Banco do Brasil and BNDES] finance the death of the planet""

In Brazil, banks are destroying biodiversity and human rights by supporting Industrial Agriculture and being loyal to the genocide government of Jair Bolsonaro.

Banco do Brasil is by far the largest financier of this sector [agricultural and livestock]. Between 2016 and 2020, around $30 billion were invested in a federal program called rural credit. In the same period, BNDES was the largest provider of resources to companies accused of causing deforestation: $3.8 billion only in April 2020.

Hier, nos rebelles ont mené une action spectaculaire devant la Banque de France pour dénoncer les investissements des banques dans les énergies fossiles 🛢

Depuis les Accords de Paris, les banques françaises ont augmenté leurs investissements dans les énergies fossiles de 19% par an...

Tout cela, grâce au soutien de la Banque Centrale Européenne, qui a créé en 2020 plus de 7000 milliards d’€ d’argent magique... 💸 dont 241 milliards pour des entreprises à forte intensité carbone 🤬

Il est urgent d’arrêter ce système mortifère.
La Banque de France et l’EuroSystème sont complices et auteurs de la 6ème extinction de masse en cours.

Nous les avons aspergés de faux-pétrole pour dénoncer leurs agissements. Il est urgent de changer si nous voulons survivre.

Merci aux euro-députés @marie_touss1 et @pierre.larrouturou qui sont venus avec nous dénoncer ces agissements destructeurs ✊💚

Dressed in their finest disco regalia. Rebels blocked multiple intersections in the city as they danced to the Bee Gees immortal hit Stayin’ Alive.

This was a fun action with a serious message.

XR music maestro Anna Slynn said that:

“Until such time as the Government acts, it’s crucial that we come together to let our leaders know that we will not sit back as they let the planet burn. We are dancing for our lives!”

“Australia was a world-leader in its response to Covid-19. We need to show the same courage, determination, and common sense in confronting the climate emergency”

This action took place on the unceded lands of the Kaurna people. We pay respect to elders, past and present. We acknowledge their sovereignty and ongoing resistance against the destructive forces of capitalism and colonialism which are fuelling the climate and ecological crisis.⁣

Pada tanggal 19 Maret 2021, XR Indonesia turut berpartisipasi dalam aksi Krisis Iklim Makin Parah, Masa Depan Banjir Darah sebagai bagian dari acara Climate Justice Now dan Global Climate Strike yang diselenggarakan di 68 negara.

Aksi ini adalah bentuk teriakkan dari warga Indonesia dalam menuntut aksi dan komitmen nyata dari pemerintah untuk menghidari masa depan yang penuh dengan bencana dan kematian akibat krisis iklim yang masih terus memperburuk.

Kebijakan iklim Indonesia masih membawa kita ke kehancuran ekologis dan ini adalah aksi bunuh diri secara perlahan yang dibebani ke semua warga Indonesia dan juga dunia. Cairan merah digunakan sebagai lambang nyawa yang telah dan akan hilang di seluruh dunia akibat krisis iklim dan ekologi.

Keadaan iklim di Indonesia beserta dengan kebijakan iklim Indonesia masih membawa kita semua skenario kehancuran dan penuh bencana yang tiada hentinya, dan untuk menghindari ini, sangat amat dibutuhkan deklarasi darurat iklim dari tingkat tertinggi negara, dan juga perubahan semua kebijakan yang bertolak belakang dengan net zero 2070 yang baru baru ini diumumkan.

""As the people who will inherit an uninhabitable planet, we the youth have been abandoned to death. The magnitude of the climate and ecological crisis demands immediate action, which the government has failed, on numerous counts, to address. On our current trajectory, we are heading for 4°C of warming by the end of the century, maybe sooner. This will result in societal collapse and billions of deaths. The ecosystems that we depend on for our survival are already starting to fall apart. The extent to which the Morrison Government can ignore this and disregard so many lives and biodiversity is painfully ludicrous.""⁣
⁣
""The system relies on the fear of the people to maintain the status quo. We are choosing to be arrested because we know what we are doing is right. By disrupting business-as-usual we are bringing attention back to the harmful impacts of fossil fuel corporations on our future.

It’s the Suffragettes! They’re calling for governments to tell the truth about the climate crisis and declare a climate emergency! ⁣
⁣
From @XRTasmania:⁣
⁣
“The Suffragettes represent a legacy of civil disobedience in women’s activism at a time when our democratic rights are under serious threat.⁣
⁣
Women worldwide and over centuries have been fighting for fairer treatment, and in particular to have a say in decisions that impact them.⁣
⁣
Now is the time to have climate-wrecking decisions reviewed and fixed. We demand climate action now!”⁣
⁣
✊🏿✊🏽✊🏾⁣✊🏼✊
⁣
The blows of climate collapse will fall more heavily on women. Women are disadvantaged in access to resources, education and decision making and more likely to care for children and elderly family. This will literally slow down the attempts of women to get to safety or to recover. Domestic violence surges during times of crisis and there are fewer options for support.⁣

On Friday, 19th March 2021 at the Global Climate Action to Stop Ecocide Sri Lanka the Red Rebel Brigade made its first appearance. 

The Red Brigade are a group dedicated to shedding light on the global environmental crisis and the climate emergency, and supports environmental groups to save humanity and all species from extinction. ♥️

The Red Rebel Brigade symbolises the common blood we share with all species, that unifies us and makes us one.

As such we move as one, act as one and more importantly feel as one. 

We are unity and we empathise with our surroundings, we are forgiving.

We are sympathetic and humble, compassionate and understanding,

We divert, distract, delight and inspire the people who watch us.

We illuminate the magic realm beneath the surface of all things and we invite people to enter in, we make a bubble and calm the storm, we are peace in the midst of war.

We are who the people have forgotten to be! 🌎♥️👫🐆🐗🐘🐳

⁣
Yesterday we stood alongside many others in grief, in rage, in love, and in protest⁣.
⁣
The Police, Crime, Sentencing & Courts Bill is yet another assault on democracy and human rights by this government. We need to stop violence against women, stand up for racial justice, end inequality and poverty, recover from covid, and defend our future from the climate and ecological crisis. And an increase in police powers that infringes on our right to protest will not solve any of this. 

#KillTheBill 
⁣
Thousands of people came to Westminster yesterday to hold a vigil to reflect on the death of Sarah Everard, Sarah Reed and all those who have died at the hands of gendered and police violence. Thousands came to say the bill, a blatant attempt to create an authoritarian police state, where the voices of ordinary people, particularly those most marginalised and disadvantaged, are silenced by state sanctioned penalties, is not the answer.

#KillTheBill⁣
⁣
This bill is a blatant erosion of democracy, but we've seen so many others from this government. Which is why we demand an upgrade to democracy, giving power to representative citizens assemblies to decide our future. To kill the bill, we will not only have to bring down statues but continue to protest until we bring down this government.⁣
⁣
#KillTheBill⁣

WE WILL NOT BE SILENCED!

The links between women's oppression and the climate and ecological crisis are deep. 😟

Have you realised how society sees nature as something to be conquered and dominated in order to exploit and profit from its resources? 💪🌲💰

What about how the systems in which most of us are socialised and conditioned to also see women as something to be conquered and dominated, meanwhile exploiting and profiting from women's unpaid labour? 💪🚺💰

Womxn (being just one of the many marginalised groups relentlessly f*caked over by white patriarchal systems and structures) are seriously and disproportionately hit by the collapsing climate and ecological systems.

From sky-rocketing domestic violence cases during mandatory lockdowns, to the severe loses of jobs, the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the struggle women face everyday. 

Patriarchal oppression is present in so many aspects of our societies. Even now, we as XR Youth Solidarity are starting to understand and confront the ways in which white, patriarchal socialisation makes our organising spaces toxic for female-bodied people.🤔

French oil giant Total and the China National Offshore Oil Corporation are on the cusp of building a massive crude oil pipeline right through the heart of Africa – displacing communities, endangering wildlife and tipping the world closer to full-blown climate catastrophe.

The East African Crude Oil Pipeline needs to be stopped and StopEACOP have a plan to do exactly that.

Already more than one million people have raised their voices – together we can #StopEACOP in its tracks and support sustainable and just alternatives driven for and by the people of East Africa.

HOW? 

ACT LOCAL - Support the communities on the front line

Local communities, human rights defenders and environmental activists are doing all they can to resist the pipeline, but they are facing increasing pressure and threats for speaking out against the corporate and political interests backing EACOP. We need to support their work and ensure their voices are heard loud and clear.

GO GLOBAL - Stop the flow of money

Building the biggest heated oil pipeline in the world is expensive work. Fortunately Total and CNOOC can’t do it alone – they need support from investors, banks and insurance firms around the world. It’s our job to highlight the risks, crank up the pressure in boardrooms and make sure EACOP is starved of the corporate and political support it needs.

WHY? 

FOR PEOPLE - EACOP threatens to displace thousands of families and farmers from their land and has already disrupted the livelihoods of many. If allowed to move forward, it would also place at risk vital water sources that millions of people rely upon for drinking and food production.

FOR NATURE - EACOP will rip through some of the world’s most important elephant, lion and chimpanzee nature reserves. There’s also concern that the pipeline will open up more critical ecosystems to even more oil extraction. 

FOR CLIMATE - EACOP will fuel climate change by enabling the extraction of oil which will generate over 34 million tons of CO2 emissions every single year. To solve the climate crisis, we must stop building new fossil fuel projects.

Climate chaos is killing us. Texas freezing below zero is only the latest, after floods, fires, mudslides, superstorms and more.

On Wednesday, March 3, 2021 Extinction Rebellion, with New York Communities for Change, Sunrise Movement, 360.org, Rise and Resist and the Rainforest Action Network, protested JP Morgan Chase and BlackRock.

Why JP Morgan Chase and Blackrock? They are the world's largest funders of climate chaos, investing hundreds of billions of dollars in fossil fuels that pollute the air, cook the planet, and displace indigenous communities. We urge them to #StopTheMoneyPipeline​.

Recently, Chase and BlackRock have attempted to appease the public with climate announcements, but their plans are vague and dangerously inadequate. Ultimately, their actions continue to fuel climate destruction.

We demand Chase and BlackRock stop financing fossil fuels and human rights violations. In particular, we demand the immediate halt to financial support for all companies in coal, in tar sands oil, and that fuel Amazon fires and violate indigenous sovereignty, including the Line 3 Pipeline.

Send a direct email to CEOs now to demand that they stop funding the toxic Line 3 pipeline:

The Future of Conservation: COP26 and Beyond brings together 4 Indigenous and local leaders from Afrika (Tanzania, Kenya) and Abya Yala (México, Brazil), with 2 academics (to be confirmed) for a moderated discussion on the future of conservation. 

👉🏾 Link to register in @XRYouthSolidarity Bio 👈🏼

COP26 is deemed by Prof Tim Flannery as 'humanity’s last chance to avoid an environmental apocalypse'. This panel is a call to action to begin building solidarity ties between Indigenous and local community leaders and academics, in order to bring a united front to COP26. The aim of this panel is not only to discuss, but to set goals and pathways to mobilize for a justice-based future of conservation.

Over the last few years there has been an increasing level of exposure around the ongoing human rights abuses and land grabs committed in the name of wildlife conservation by numerous Global North NGOs. This panel is born out of the #DecoloniseConservation campaign, a youth education, action and solidarity campaign which seeks to mobilise the Global North environmental movement against fortress and colonial conservation in solidarity with Indigenous and local communities.

#DecoloniseConservation, an engagement campaign from XR Youth Solidarity, proposes that conservation efforts responding to the climate crisis must be led by Indigenous and/or local communities, and that the role of Global North conservation organizations must be transformed to ensure a future of conservation based on justice.

Join us for what promises to be an exciting panel to mobilize for a new paradigm of conservation.

🚨We have received an urgent request from the Indigenous peoples of the Amazon (COICA). They are asking us to do a small action today, Friday 26th February 2021!

📰 As you will have heard on the news, the Indigenous people of the Amazon have been suffering terribly during these times due to COVID-19. But what you might not have heard is that as they have retreated into isolation to escape infection. And companies and individuals have taken this opportunity to further grab forest land.  

There is a sense of depression and losing heart.  

But they have created an action this weekend, to shout out against this injustice and have asked us to support them.   

The Action:  👉🏾 Send a message of support by writing these words on paper or card: El Grito de la Selva The Jungle Screams). Take a picture and post on your social media channels with the hashtags: #ElGritoDeLaSelva #SOSAmazonia #AmazoniaVivaHumanidadSegura

If you have time to make it look beautiful, great. But if you don’t, just send the words and some love. Please write where you come from so they can see where the support is coming from. 

They cannot see us all, but let’s help them feel they are not alone – we stand with them in their suffering as they defend what is precious to us all.💚

We aim to fund 20+ local Extinction Rebellion groups in the Global South, particularly in Africa, so that all rebels can take meaningful action on World Water Day, irrespective of where we are located. 

❔Why World Water Day❔

Because water is a life or death issue especially in the time of COVID-19: two in five people still do not have basic hand washing facilities. One in three people have no access to drinking water. 

And the effects of climate change ravage many countries in the Global South with altered rainfall patterns, flooding and drought. 

While extractive industries pollute precious water. 

So rebels in many countries in the Global South want their voices to be heard!

❔How Will Funding Be Spent❔

Rebels in the Global South are planning a wide range of actions from protest, to awareness raising and practical solutions. Support is urgently needed!

‘Listen to this Baka man explain how he was tortured for hunting to feed his family. [...] Across Africa, tribal people are accused of “poaching” because they hunt to feed their families. And they face arrest, beatings, torture and death, while big game trophy hunters are encouraged.’ - @survivalinternational

Not only does the treatment of Indigenous and local communities so blatantly violate human rights, it also dramatically affects our chances of averting climate and ecological collapse. Indigenous people safeguard a whopping 80% of the entire Earth’s land biodiversity, despite only being 5% of the human population.

Local communities are equally essential in protecting and strengthening biodiversity! They too are on the frontlines of collapsing ecosystems and environmental degradation, with invaluable knowledge of how to look after their land.

Fortress Conservation, the violent model of conservation, was initiated by white-supremacist Western “conservationists” to preserve their exclusive access to what they consider ‘pristine’ landscapes for the benefit of the elites, rather than the environment, excluding those who had lived and cared for the land for centuries. This model has since been exported across the world to now involve a sinister joint enterprise of large conservation organisations such as @WWF WildlifeConservationSociety, NatureConservancy, @ExxonMobil @Bp_plc @Shell @CocaCola @WorldBank @the_IMF and local and national governments.

Together they continue to create a world divided into “Developed” areas - destroying the ecosystem - and “protected areas” - where locals and their cultures are removed. Instead, we must all learn to live in harmony with plants, animals and each other.

⛔ Nel 2021, il diritto ad un’informazione seria e trasparente viene sistematicamente ignorato dalla stampa italiana.

⛔ Notizie che meriterebbero la prima pagina vengono limitate a trafiletti riempitivi, se non omesse, mentre gli allarmi di decine di migliaia di scienziati vengono ancora filtrati con il placido ottimismo di chi afferma che la transizione ecologica sia qualcosa di facoltativo, o che in ogni caso si stia già facendo abbastanza per metterla in atto. 

Come può la realtà rovinosa della crisi climatica ed ecologica entrare nel senso comune se i mezzi di comunicazione di massa sembrano più preoccupati di rassicurare che di informare?

Come può un cittadino italiano medio prendere coscienza della propria impronta ecologica e della necessità di cambiamenti strutturali se non sa di essere in pericolo?

Come può chiedere nuove leggi a tutela della vita se non sa che è in corso la Sesta Estinzione di Massa?

E se una volta consapevole lo Stato non ascolta, come può non ribellarsi?

🏭 Sappiamo che una bugia ripetuta abbastanza volte diventa una verità, come il fatto che chiedere che sia fatto il necessario ad evitare il suicidio della nostra civiltà sia qualcosa di “bello” e “nobile”, ma che tuttavia non può prescindere dalla crescita economica infinita.

🏭 Non basta un tocco di verde per potersi definire innocenti, se intanto ci si macchia di sangue firmando ancora assegni miliardari per le compagnie di estrazione di combustibili fossili.

MEDIA, DITE LA VERITÀ*

*Gli scenari sono PIÙ che catastrofici

➡️ +2°C oltre i livelli preindustriali = insicurezza alimentare, disordini sociali, aumento di cataclismi e milioni di sfollati

➡️ +4°C = crollo ecosistemico e rischio concreto di estinzione umana

SIAMO NELLA SESTA ESTINZIONE DI MASSA

📅 Thursday, 4th of March 
⏰ 10.00AM (UTC)
📍Norwegian embassies and consulates around the world

On the 4th of March, citizens around the world are protesting against the climate hypocrisy of Norway and the government’s suppression of climate activism. There will be demonstrations at Norwegian embassies and consulates in cities such as Seoul, Rome, Ottawa, Rio de Janeiro, Stockholm and Copenhagen. Join the protest against Norway’s double standard as an oil state that presents itself as a proponent of climate agreements.

The Norwegian Prime Minister, Erna Solberg, proudly boasts that “the person who will shut down Norwegian oil production has not yet been born”. One reason why she says that is that her government is punishing climate activists with fines of up to 20.000 NOK (approximately 2.000 Euros) for civil disobedience.

On the 21st September 2020, 53 Extinction Rebellion Norway activists were arrested for blocking the road in downtown Oslo and for protesting at the Ministry of Oil and Energy. As a result, they received fines which totaled over 100,000 Euros. This stands in stark contrast to the governments’ reaction in Sweden, Denmark, France and Netherlands where there were similar protests at the same time. In these countries, the police broke up the demonstrations without resorting to mass arrests or heavy fines.
The fines levied on the climate activists in Oslo on the 21st of September 2020 were significantly higher than the fines given out to violent protesters in 2019. It is ironic that the country that gave the Nobel Peace Prize to Martin Luther King Jr. in 1964 suppresses civil disobedience with so-called “preventive methods” when it is directed against current Norwegian policies.

Por eso el 11 de diciembre pasado, lanzamos la Alianza Mundial contra el Fracking realizando acciones simultáneas de solidaridad internacional en 20 países de todo el mundo. De esta manera conectamos los puntos de extracción de la industria principalmente en países del Sur, con su contraparte del consumo en el Norte Global, poniendo el foco sobre las multinacionales que están entre las principales impulsoras del fracking en el mundo.

El siguiente video es el tráiler de esa acción, que solo fue un puntapié inicial y logró gran convocatoria a pesar de las difíciles condiciones de confinamiento en muchos países. Ahora debemos seguir uniéndonos, de cara al #DiaMundialdelAgua el 22 de Marzo, en que realizaremos la próxima acción mundial. El agua ha empezado a cotizar en Wall Street como un activo de especulación financiero, y debemos recuperarla como un derecho humano básico e inalienable antes de que sea demasiado tarde!

¡Únete y sigamos conectando el Norte con el Sur hasta frenar el fracking y las demás industrias que están destruyendo nuestros países!

Gisterochtend voerden veertig rebellen van Extinction Rebellion (XR) actie op Schiphol! De rebellen wierpen zowel voor als achter de douane blokkades op, lijmden zich vast aan balies, gaven speeches en voerden zelfs een klein theaterstuk op. Zij eisten dat de luchtvaart haar CO2-uitstoot terugbrengt tot netto nul in 2025. 

KLM is als grootste gebruiker van Schiphol voor zo'n vijftien procent in handen van de Nederlandse overheid en heeft anno 2021 nog steeds geen serieus beleid om de CO2-uitstoot terug te dringen. Toch ontvangt het elk jaar 5 miljard staatssteun, een lening die waarschijnlijk nooit wordt terugbetaald. Extinction Rebellion spreekt hier schande van. Hoe kan het zijn dat grootvervuilers zoveel subsidie ontvangen terwijl veel gewone burgers met moeite de eindjes aan elkaar knopen?

Tijdens de actie werden zeven rebellen opgepakt. Gelukkig zijn zij allemaal inmiddels weer vrij. 

Ben jij boos over al die miljarden voor grootvervuilers als KLM? Wil jij dat de overheid nu eindelijk met eerlijk en effectief klimaatbeleid komt? Sluit je aan bij Extinction Rebellion en zet de overheid onder druk. Altijd vreedzaam, maar ook creatief en rebels. Samen zorgen wij voor verandering! Kom naar een informatiebijeenkomst en ontdek wat jij kan doen.

Just as the climate movement demands climate justice, justice is needed in nature conservation! In national parks, for example, one sees that without justice in conservation Indigenous people are banished from their lands or even killed. Here it should be noted: 80% of all the world's biodiversity is currently found on the lands of Indigenous peoples, because they generally maintain very regenerative lifestyles that place little stress on ecosystems.

A systemic change in conservation is  needed, with realistic effort to address the high rates of consumption by people in the Global North, and biodiversity loss brought about by industries and the governments that enable them. 

Therefore, @extinctionrebelliondeutschland have launched the #NatureNeedsJustice campaign from the Global North to reflect on our responsibility and how we think and act.

The campaign aims to raise awareness that conservation in the past and today is often linked to racism, and to identify solutions for just conservation that protects human rights and biodiversity at the same time.

📅 February Schedule

Week 1 - 1-5 February:
• 30% by 2030: The “Global Deal For Nature”. Why we need to stop it and what the alternatives are. 

Week 2 - 8-12 February: 
• Tackling the real drivers of biodiversity loss and exploitation- from economic growth and overconsumption to alternative economies and systems change. 

Week 3 - 15-19 February 
• Turning towards an agriculture which supports life - from industrial agriculture to food sovereignty and biodiversity. 

Week 4 - 22-26 February 
• Commodification and financialisation of Nature

This Monday @xrthehague were at the Peace Palace to bring attention to the fact that ecocide is not recognised  as a crime.

This is perhaps not surprising in a system that is built on the large-scale exploitation of people and ecosystems. But more and more people are becoming aware of the (partially irreversible) damage done - even the Dutch state has recognised the need to act when it signed the Paris Agreement. 

But declarations such as the Paris Agreement are void if they are not followed by action! 

🕵️ Making ecocide a crime would be a first step in giving injured communities the legal means to combat the forces that are still destroying their livelihoods today.

The court case that @milieudefensie won against @shell on behalf of four Nigerian farmers was a hopeful sign. But it took them 13 years and 1.5 million euros to win - an amount that is too damn high! We therefore need clearer legal frameworks so that companies can be more easily held accountable for their dirty business practices! ✊

President @gotabayar signals his intention to degazette the Dahiyagala/Dahaiyagala Wildlife Sanctuary (Tier IV), which also serves a critical Secondary Dual Purpose as a “Wild Elephant Corridor”, linking Udawalawe National Park (Tier II) with the Bogahapelessa National Reserved Forest (Tier Ib), allowing for the movement of wildlife populations out of Udawalawe National Park‼️🗣️

Originally demarcated, declared and gazetted (as per Extraordinary Gazette No. 1239/28), on the 07th of June 2002, the Dahiyagala/Dahaiyagala Wildlife Sanctuary (Tier IV) is a 27 Square Kilometre Protected Area (PA) that is situated in the Moneragala District of the Uva Province. It is nestled amidst Udawalawe National Park (to the south west) and the Bogahapelessa National Reserved Forest (to the north east) and serves a Secondary Dual Purpose as a “Wild Elephant Corridor”, facilitating the continued movement of both Wild Elephants and other terrestrial wildlife populations between the two aforementioned Protected Areas (PAs). 🏞️

This would be catastrophic for Udawalawe’s Wild Elephant Population, a significant percentage of which depends on Dahiyagala/Dahaiyagala’s existence to travel back and forth between the Park and the Bogahapelessa National Reserved Forest (to the north east), in order to reach their feeding grounds and mineral deposits in the Intermediate Zone. 🐘

We now call upon the Cabinet Minister of the Ministry of Wildlife Resources and Forest Conservation (MoWRFC) C.B. Ratnayake, and the Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC) to prevent the decimation of this Wildlife Sanctuary‼️ 🌏⏳

This means potential emissions from coal, oil, and gas already in production exhaust the carbon budget for 2°C, let alone 1.5°C, so any expansion of fossil extraction, or expansion of infrastructure that drives expanded extraction, is incompatible with the Paris Agreement.

This is a letter Konstantin Fokin wrote in prison. Please support him by helping spread the word as he is going to be in a Russian prison for 22 days and is going to go on hunger strike!

This is an extract of what the letter says:

""We have many reasons to protest. The very right to (peaceful) protest is one of them. Very important. Maybe the most important one. Like other rights, it will not fall from the sky, it must be fought for. 

It seemed right to start a hunger strike. Nothing special is needed for this. You can do it almost anywhere. 
I'll try to hold on until the end of the arrest. I'll stop earlier if the following conditions are met:

• All cases initiated by peaceful protesters following 23.01.2021
• Delete article 212.1. from the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation

Peaceful protest should not become an offense or a crime.""

Menjadi negara tropis dan kepulauan telah membuktikan Indonesia di posisi yang sangat ""strategis"" untuk terkena dampak krisis iklim. Kenaikan permukaan air laut, punahnya spesies, kekeringan, hingga bencana ekologis seperti banjir akan semakin parah dan semakin sering terjadi. Hal ini jelas akan mengancam kehidupan yang ada, sehingga sudah saatnya Indonesia mendeklarasikan ""darurat iklim"". 

Beberapa rebels di Kota Malang telah melakukan Banner Strike di pusat kota yaitu Alun-Alun Kota Malang, dengan menyampaikan pesan: ""Indonesia Darurat Krisis Iklim"".

Bencana akibat krisis iklim sudah semakin marak, dan apabila tetap dibiarkan, semakin buruk dampaknya.

Ayo, kita suarakan bersama tuntutan kita pada para pemangku kebijakan untuk melakukan aksi nyata agar kita semua bisa terbebas dari krisis iklim ini.

When a single part of biodiversity is lost or degraded, this negatively affects the functioning of the whole system.

Which is why the DECLINE OF BEES populations is very WORRYING.

Bees are VITAL FOR THE SURVIVAL of ecosystems that create food sources for many different species, including us.

If bees disappeared, many of the fruits, vegetables and nuts that we currently enjoy would become scarce or disappear entirely .

Many animals would lose their food source and disappear too.

Our planet is a lot like us. In much the same way that we rely on our hearts, lungs, and muscles to keep us alive and strong, our planet relies on biodiversity to do the same.

In order to do this well, the planet needs a good balance between three different types of diversity: genetic diversity, species diversity, and ecosystem diversity.

Why❓

🌱 Over 1.3 billion Indians depend on the agricultural sector and have dealt with numerous crises for decades. On January 26th, the government will be celebrating the adoption of its Constitution with a military parade, while continuing to perpetuate harmful policies that violate their own Constitution.

🟢 On the other hand over 250 million farmers have been protesting all over, in an effort to convince the union government to repeal the new farm bills. Not only do the laws, which were basically bulldozed through the parliament with no proper deliberation or discussion with the stakeholders, take into consideration any of the farmers' concerns, it also threatens to do away with systems like APMC mandis and the MSP, thereby crippling a group of people already plagued by debt and suicide.   

🌿 At a higher level, given that India’s agrarian culture and varied regional climate have significantly contributed to the global food basket, the laws, exacerbated by the devastating impacts of the climate crisis, will compound global economic insecurity, threaten global food production and overall livability (higher food prices, food security and shortages). 
 
🗺️ These protests impact us all.

🇮🇳 India's farmers and citizens need the global community to pay attention — the world needs to know that India is retreating from a democracy, regressing at an alarming pace and rushing headlong into fascism. International focus on these protests may be the only thing preventing state-sponsored violence and another massacre in India.

📖 Learn more about this and ask you any questions you might have on a zoom call with an ASHA (Alliance for Sustainable & Holistic Agriculture) & Greens with Farmers’ Coalition representative on the 23rd of January.

🗳️ Organised and funded by ordinary people, not the government. There was no pre-existing support in the US for Citizens’ Assemblies; this really is an innovative and trailblazing event for all Americans.

⚖️ Initiated by activists but coordinated independently by a group consisting of representatives from government, academia, and the non-profit community to maintain impartiality. Supported by the Center for Climate Assemblies in Poland (https://climateassemblies.org) on this matter. 

📜 The goal is to create space where people, in a politically divided state (big urban/rural divides), can come together to present solutions to the state legislature.

💪 Organisers said XR's third demand provided a lot of inspiration and momentum for getting this initiated! 

👉🏾 The Washington Climate Assembly is a virtual event convening 80 Washington State residents in January 2021 to learn about, discuss, and recommend climate change solutions for consideration by the State Legislature. Assemblies have been used worldwide to help shape the work of governments, and this virtual event will focus on climate mitigation strategies that equitably support communities disproportionately impacted by climate change. 

👉🏾 Assembly members will be chosen through a lottery to accurately represent the state in terms of demographics such as age, ethnicity, geographic distribution, and political perspectives. 

👉🏾 The event will be live streamed and recorded in January 2021 via Zoom and available for subsequent viewing on the WA Climate Assembly’s website and YouTube channel. 

👉 Visit www.waclimateassembly.org to learn more about the WA Climate Assembly process and livestream date.

No, dos días de nieve no desmienten décadas de conocimiento sobre la crisis climática. 

Por si hiciera falta, vamos a recordar algunos conceptos básicos del método científico:

En primer lugar, siempre debemos distinguir bien entre un caso y una tendencia. 

Un caso, o un momento, es un evento particular y muy localizado en el tiempo: como una semana de frío inusual. 

Una tendencia es un proceso general cuya existencia deducimos a partir de la observación de todos los casos particulares durante largos periodos de tiempo: como el calentamiento global, demostrado en el ascenso continuado de las temperaturas medias globales desde mediados del siglo XX, (con la famosa ""pala de hockey"" que se observa a partir de los años 70). 

Negar una tendencia (como el calentamiento global) seleccionando una fracción de casos particulares se denomina falacia “cherry picking”, y es muy habitual en el negacionismo y las teorías de la conspiración. 

Cuando nos encontramos en una situación de confrontación con posturas negacionistas, es importante tener muy claro lo siguiente: discutir de igual a igual con el negacionismo no es razonable, ni deseable, ni constructivo. Poner la ciencia y el negacionismo al mismo nivel sólo crea una falsa sensación de debate abierto, que no se corresponde al consenso científico en el tema, y legitima al negacionismo como una postura defendible (que es exactamente lo que busca). 

Ahora bien, tampoco es razonable, ni deseable ni constructivo responder de manera agresiva, insultando o ridiculizando a los negacionistas. Nuestro objetivo es concienciar y pasar a la acción, y nadie va a escuchar a quien le insulta. Este es uno de los diez principios de Extinction Rebellion.

Insistamos siempre en el consenso científico inapelable en esta cuestión, denunciemos las falacias lógicas habituales del negacionismo (“cherry picking”, confusión de procesos breves con largos, falsos términos medios, falacias ad hominem contra la comunidad científica...) y, sobre todo, recordemos que se trata de un tema en el que nos jugamos nuestra supervivencia, literalment

Extinction Rebellion cause disruption in the CBD to say: Extreme fire danger is the new normal, due to the climate emergency
 
On Monday 11 January at 12:30 pm, Extinction Rebellion (XR) protesters held a pop-up protest in Perth CBD, as bushfires continue to rage across the state one year after Black Summer.

The protest highlights the connection between the climate emergency and the bushfire emergency in response to the recent bushfires that have torn through Western Australia.
Recent bushfires across the state have endangered lives, damaged ecosystems and forced people to evacuate their homes.
XR spokesperson Gerard Mazza says, “we are causing disruption to remind people that the climate emergency creates deadly fire conditions. We must recognise this and act now on the climate crisis, to avoid further danger.”

XR demand that media and government tell the truth about the climate crisis. Scientific evidence states that the climate crisis makes bushfires more likely and severe.

Mr Mazza says, “We don’t want to cause an inconvenience for people, but we don’t have much choice, given that those in power have failed to tell the truth or to act. Someone has to sound the alarm.

“All media outlets should be highlighting the climate emergency in their reporting on bushfires. Government must tell the truth, too, by declaring a climate emergency and conveying the full extent of the dangers we face.”

Some Extinction Rebellion members have experienced the effects of bushfires firsthand. Julie Marsh is an Extinction Rebellion member from Denmark, Western Australia. She says, “I live with the constant threat of bushfire in our drying climate. Summer is no longer a pleasure, as I scan the horizon and sniff the air for smoke everday. I will it to stay cool, to protect our beautiful forest, and to protect my husband and two sons from having to go to fight the fire.”

Just as the climate movement demands climate justice, justice is needed in nature conservation! In national parks, for example, one sees that without justice in conservation Indigenous people are banished from their lands or even killed. Here it should be noted: 80% of all the world's biodiversity is currently found on the lands of Indigenous peoples, because they generally maintain very regenerative lifestyles that place little stress on ecosystems.

A systemic change in conservation is needed. Solutions like CO2-offsetting and green capitalism will not save life on this planet. Even more so if nothing is done about the consumption of people in the Global North and the industries and governments responsible for biodiversity loss.

Therefore, @extinctionrebelliondeutschland are launching the #NatureNeedsJustice campaign from the Global North to reflect on our responsibility and how we think and act. 

The campaign aims to raise awareness that conservation in the past and today is often linked to racism, and to identify solutions for just conservation that protects human rights and biodiversity at the same time.

📅 January Schedule

Week 1 - 11-15 January:
• The path to justice in the struggle for a liveable future - decolonisation, allyship and self-reflection

Week 2 - 18-22 January: 
• The racist and colonial roots of nature conservation and its neo-colonial present 

Week 3 - 25-29 January 
• Indigenous communities and biodiversity - securing land rights of communities and giving land back

They are calling for New Yorkers to rise up with indigenous Gwich’in and Inupiaq leaders, who oppose oil extraction in the Arctic Refuge, with An Hour of Solidarity during the lease sale, from 9:30am-10:30 AKST (1:30-2:30pm EST). Extinction Rebellion NYC invites the public, together with the organization Defend the Sacred Alaska, to voice outrage at this rushed and illegal lease sale through the Twitter hashtag #ProtectTheArcticRefuge, because oil extraction threatens all our futures and global climate stability.

With harmfully short notice, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) announced on December 7th that they will sell oil leases in what Native leaders call ‘The Sacred Place Where Life Begins’ — Iizhik Gwats’an Gwandaii Goodlit — also known as the Coastal Plain of the Arctic Refuge. On November 17th, the BLM announced a “Call for Nominations,” asking companies to submit their leasing interests. This followed the Record of Decision (on the Final Environmental Impact Statement), released August 17th, in which was selected Alternative B: the most egregious and harmful option. This opens the entire coastal plain, the birthing grounds of the Porcupine Caribou, to oil extraction.

In Ghana, climate change has led to many families losing their main source of income as crops fail to grow due to water scarcity. 

As a result, many families have found themselves unable to afford hygienic menstrual items for their daughters.

In the Kurugu community, over two thirds of girls miss school every month because of this‼️

PeriodLink x GAYO’s plans to set up a reusable pad-making start-up and build three new boreholes aims to tackle these issues.

We will be facilitating the creation of women-led businesses that produce reusable sanitary items, as well as raising funds to build three new boreholes to grant greater access to water.💧 

To get this project on its feet as soon as possible, we need your help to purchase the machinery and materials necessary for the start-up and the boreholes. Each and any amount helps!

What is the campaign?

@globalmajorityvs are taking the UK Government to court for their violations of our human rights.

(Articles 2,8,14)

The UK Gov has been failing its own international obligations on climate and failing its duty to safeguard our rights.

We must stop this Government leading us to 4^C warming, which means the complete, genocide and ecocide of the Global Majority - that’s our friends and families around the world, our heritage communities, and our future as young people. That’s genocide for Afrika, Asia, Abya Yala (the Americas, including the Caribbean and Latin America), all small island states and indigenous communities everywhere. 

The UK Government should fund community repairs, planet repairs, and Global initiatives for repair, but instead it is funding 15% of global emissions and projects of ecocide and genocide all so that it can carry on with ‘business as usual’. 

The campaign is for us to claim back the opportunity to transform our society, repair our communities, fix our miseducation, and build a collective strategy for justice and the guarantee of no more violations of our rights.

We are the Global Majority: Stop the Harm, Fund the Repair!

“It is now 2020 and in the five years since the Paris Agreement was signed we have seen precious little action at the scale required to keep to the 2°C limit, let alone the 1.5°C one. And we do not have long left to act. Given the appalling lack of adequate action to date, limiting global heating to 1.5°C is really the very most we can hope for right now

We are at an intersection of global crises. Climate breakdown, ecological collapse, societal collapse, Covid-19 – all are symptoms of a toxic system that is driving us to extinction.

We cannot carry on like this. The system is killing us

The government knows the truth and still they pave the way for future crises. They ignored warnings about coronavirus and tens of thousands have died. Millions suffered. Now they’re ignoring predictions the world will pass 1.5°C in the next 5 years. That’s goodbye Paris Climate Agreement

Change is now. It’s time to decide together how we move forward in this emergency

As the coronavirus crisis exposes the sickness at the heart of our political leadership, humanity stands at a crossroads

We need to work together towards dismantling this toxic system to co-build a fairer, kinder, more humane society – or miss our best chance of mitigating the worst of the climate and ecological emergency

To stop the harm we must stand together and act now. Together we are powerful. Crisis doesn’t have to mean collapse

Vielen Dank an alle tapferen Menschen, die sich der Zerstörung in den Weg stellen und heute dabei waren und an die, die seit Wochen und Monaten trotz Schnee und Kälte, Polizeigewalt und Repressionen vor Ort sind. Bei Minusgraden wurden heute Wasserwerfer, Schlagstöcke und Pfefferspray eingesetzt. Und trotz aller Widrigkeiten und Rückschläge wächst dieses Bündnis immer weiter zusammen.

Bratislava, Slovakia

We built a symbolic gallows on Kamenný náměstí

Today and yesterday, we symbolically hanged ourselves standing on melting ice cubes. The art installation located on Kamenný náměstí in Bratislava symbolized the melting of the polar and mountain glaciers, which is caused by global warming.

10. – 11. decembra prebehne rokovanie Európskej rady, počas ktorého sa rozhodne o dôležitých klimatických cieľoch na najbližšiu dekádu. Požadujeme, aby sa Slovensko zaviazalo k zníženiu emisií minimálne o 65%, ako odporúča Medzivládny panel pre zmenu klímy (IPCC). K tomuto cieľu sa pred voľbami zaviazali tri zo štyroch vládnych strán súčasnej koalície a my sme chceli tento záväzok touto cestou premiérovi pripomenúť.

Globálne otepľovanie, jeden z prejavov klimatickej krízy, spôsobené ľudskou priemyselnou  činnosťou, postupuje stále rýchlejšie. Z novej štúdie publikovanej v magazíne Nature Climate Change vyplýva, že roztápanie ľadovcov v Grónsku a na Arktíde zodpovedá najhoršiemu možnému scenáru Medzivládneho panelu pre zmenu klímy (IPCC). S podobným problémom sa potýkajú aj horské ľadovce. Napríklad alpské ľadovce stratili od začiatku 21. storočia približne šestinu ľadu a rýchlosť topenia ľadu v Himalájach sa za posledných 20 rokov v porovnaní s rokmi 1975 – 2000 zdvojnásobila. Takto masívna strata vody ovplyvňuje a ovplyvní jej dostupnosť pre stovky miliónov ľudí vo všetkých podhorských oblastiach sveta, čo s vysokou pravdepodobnosťou prehĺbi migráciu. Tento problém sa týka aj Slovenska. Každoročné znižovanie hladiny podzemnej vody priamo súvisí s malým úhrnom snehových zrážok. 

Apelovali sme však nielen na premiéra, ale aj na vôľu bežných ľudí pre podporu a prijatie zelenej politiky, ktorá môže znamenať aj zdanlivo nepríjemné opatrenia. Myslíme si, že táto zmena umožní ľuďom žiť kvalitnejší a plnohodnotnejší život v čistejšom a zdravšom prostredí. Slovensko má v porovnaní s okolitými krajinami najlepšie predpoklady stať sa lídrom v znižovaní emisií skleníkových plynov.

Would we take back the issues around food sovereignty🥗
Today and tomorrow, let's participate in the creation of this world accordingly 🤗

If we don't quickly create a resilient, regenerative and just food system, we can never shut down the supermarkets and the fossil fuel industry without throwing our society into a food shortage 😬

Let us reappropriate our territories, to give back meaning to our future, to ensure that the crisis is not endured and exclusive, but the occasion of united, resilient and autonomous territories!

When the state deliberately abandons its responsibility to protect its citizens, it itself breaks the social contract.
Revolt then becomes our most sacred right, and our most indispensable duty.
Because every tenth of a degree counts, because each extinct species counts, because every minute counts, we are calling for a food revolution!

Together we came up with 3 stories, or scenarios, for alternative futures. Each tells a story of a possible future based on an analysis of forces in play today. 

The Insurrection is set in 2030 rural KwaZuluNatal, South Africa, The Uprising is set in a 2030 Karachi, Pakistan and The Invitation is set in 2030 Oaxaca, Mexico. 

Each story plays with 3 “driving forces” shaping our future. 

The first is runaway climate change, which given our current emissions trajectory, looks set to worsen dramatically by 2030. 

The second is digital technology. We considered two poles. One pole is constrained digital transformation, where regulatory bodies or corporate governance constrain technology. The other pole is unconstrained digital transformation, where there are no brakes or constraints on technology. 

Then finally, we considered the state of  government, where either people fear government, or government fears the people. 

Each story presents an alternative future. They are NOT predictions. They are provocations. The aim of these stories is getting a better grip on our present and the potential consequences of our choices. 

As you read through these stories, consider three questions:

What feelings do each of the scenarios evoke in you personally?

Which scenario did you feel most attracted to and why? Which did you feel most uncomfortable with and why? How do you relate these scenarios to your life?

What shifts in the present are required to move towards a more desirable future and to avoid more harmful ones?

⛓Corporations are behind the mass destruction that consumerism has unleashed on the planet we share with all beings. Pollution, emissions and waste are all chocking our people and our planet, while consumption happens every day of the year, not only on Black Friday #TellTheTruth

#BlockFriday is NOT an opportunity to blame and shame the low-income families and people that rely on the discounted prices this day affords. It is an opportunity to make governments accountable to reign in corporations’ greed for the sake of life on Earth 🌎🚨 #ActNow #PeoplePower

⚙️ #BlackFriday is a testament to our system’s unchecked extremist consumerism at the expense of exploited workers and extracted materials, which destroy ecosystems and the livelihoods of many species, including humans 

We are in the 6th mass extinction. Our climate and ecosystems are collapsing. We need to REFUSE, REDUCE, REUSE, REPAIR, RECYCLE ♻️ We simply cannot afford to consume so violently: life is on the line. And we rebel for life! 🌱

📍[JAKARTA]

Generasi muda adalah kunci masa depan dunia. Sayangnya krisis iklim dan aktivitas manusia dapat menimbulkan kesenjangan yang berbeda antara kehidupan generasi saat ini  dengan generasi masa depan. Padahal, generasi saat inilah yang memegang kunci kendali terhadap kondisi lingkungan di masa depan. Namun, kebijakan iklim Indonesia masih belum mempertimbangkan hal ini. Pengendalian krisis iklim yang tidak serius justru dapat mengancam kesejahteraan anak-anak dan generasi masa depan.

Pada Hari Anak Sedunia, Extinction Rebellion Indonesia menuntut Kebijakan Iklim yang Berkeadilan Antargenerasi, sehingga dapat menjamin hak untuk hidup layak anak-anak dan generasi mendatang. Kami menuntut hal tersebut melalui aksi Toy Strike yang dilaksanakan di tiga kota: Malang, Makassar dan Jakarta.

Aksi kami di Jakarta hampir dibubarkan oleh pihak kepolisian, akan tetapi terus kami jalankan karena bersuara mengungkapkan aspirasi di ruang publik secara damai sudah menjadi hak setiap warga Indonesia yang dilindungi oleh UUD 1945.

Toy Strike merupakan salah satu bentuk dari Non-Violent Direct Action (NVDA) yang disesuaikan dengan kondisi pandemi. Dalam pelaksaanannya, kami membuka donasi mainan dan pesan aspirasi, agar semua orang bisa berpartisipasi tanpa risiko kesehatan. Mainan dan signage yang didonasikan tersebutlah yang akan menyampaikan aspirasi kita semua, yaitu: Kami Ingin Hidup

Kami percaya bahwa dalam menyampaikan aspirasi, kita memerlukan cara yang kreatif agar bisa menarik perhatian lebih banyak orang. Terlebih karena adanya pandemi yang mempersempit ruang kami untuk mengekspresikan diri. Maka dari itu, kami percaya melakukan mengungkapkan keresahan kami melalui aksi langsung tanpa kekerasan (NVDA) maupun melalui karya seni.

Selain Toy Strike, kami juga akan menyampaikan aspirasi terkait Keadilan Antargenerasi dengan seni, yaitu melalui pameran #TuaMudaPetuahKita di mana kita akan menampilkan sejumlah karya seni mengenai topik ini.

Yuk saksikan Opening Night pameran kami pada 25 November 2020!

🌐 The United Nations's IMO — facebook.com/IMOHQ —  and its delegates representing countries from all over the world met this week and decided to CONTINUE TORCHING humankind's present and future by allowing shipping's carbon emissions to grow at least until 2030.
.
💢 Yet the United Nations body says that it exists to ""ensure the peaceful, cooperative, legally defined uses of the seas and oceans for the individual and common benefit of humankind.""
.
😮 Common benefit of humankind⁉️ They're leading us to extinction‼️
.
⚓ The shipping industry produces 1 BILLION tonnes of C02 each year. That’s more CO2 than all but the top five highest emitting countries in the world, but we never talk about it. And world governments, just as with aviation, don't even include these figures in their own carbon budgets and much less do they include the embodied emissions of what is shipped and then consumed within their own borders. 
.
🐬 Shipping is one of THE biggest drivers of the climate and ecological crisis and everything related to shipping must dramatically change if we are to stand a chance.
.
🌊 So on Sunday #TheOceanRebellion carried out work commissioned by the #BlueRebellion at the #IMO, the only UN body with offices in the UK.
.
.
⌛The IMO's Marine Environment Protection Committee meeting was hosted by the #BalticExchange, home to the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS). ICS are a co-sponsor of the IMO’s latest climate “non-regulation” that allows ship GHG emissions to continue rising until 2030.
.
🎭 So on Monday, a trio of the masked suited characters representing ship industry executives appeared at the meeting's venue, this time vomiting and urinating fake oil onto a sculpture of a baby polar bear.

In this in-depth interview, Jimmy speaks about his people’s resistance strategies and ancestral stories, and how the indigenous worldview could help to combat climate change.

As part of their resistance, Jimmy and a group of young Siekopai leaders have developed a number of innovative projects, safeguarding ancestral shamanic knowledge in video format and running environmental workshops with Siekopai youth. 

Their next goal is to open an alternative school with an educational model based on their own cosmovision. Please consider making a small donation or sharing their crowdfunding campaign to help them achieve this dream. (@nacion.siekopai)

🌳 More than 700,000 hectares of Sri Lankan Wilderness Areas (the size of 980,000 football pitches) are made up of Other State Forests. 

🗣️ However, a recent decision taken by the Government of Sri Lanka, revoked Government Circulars No. 05 of 2001 and No. 02 of 2006 (which were introduced by previous Governments to protect these valuable forests), removing all protections from these forests and leaving them open to deforestation and land grabbing.

🇱🇰 Some of these Other State Forests are classified as Upper Montane Forests or “Cloud Forests” (less than 1% of the world’s woodlands are “Cloud Forests”), with the majority of these forests acting as lifelines for many endangered, endemic and point endemic plants and animals in Sri Lanka. 

Deforestation could lead to the loss of these endemic species to the world forever. 

🏭 These forests also act as carbon sinks, so if we lose them, we will not only lose the ability to sequester carbon but also release the carbon that was stored in these forests over thousands of years, contributing to global climate change.

On top of dealing with the global pandemic, the Philippines is now suffering the effects of the climate crisis with the arrival of 5 destructive typhoons within the past 4 weeks.

Most recently, Typhoon Vamco slammed northern regions of the country, leaving thousands struggling to survive. 

Extinction Rebellion Philippines is calling on rebels to donate to relief efforts and to help spread the word about what our country is experiencing. 

Please visit @extinctionrebellionph @thisiszerohourph or @yacaphilippines for more information! #ReliefPH 

The Philippines is no stranger to typhoons, with the country experiencing 20 typhoons over the past year. However, climate change is expected to lead to more intense typhoons and storm surges, which will affect vulnerable areas like the Philippines first.

📱 DIGITAL ACTION 📱- please repost this across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram tagging @shell to let them know we haven’t forgotten about the Ogoni 9 ✊

☠️ This 10th November marks the 25th anniversary of the murder of Ken Saro-Wiwa, Saturday Dobee, Nordu Eawo, Daniel Gbooko, Paul Levera, Felix Nuate, Baribor Bera, Barinem Kiobel, and John Kpuine. The Ogoni 9 activists were arrested and executed for protesting against Shell’s actions in the Niger Delta 

🚱 Shell has been extracting oil reserves under the wetlands of the Niger Delta, causing oil spills, gas leaks, and land, water, and air pollution on an enormous scale for decades. The Niger Delta is now one of the most polluted places on Earth, and the United Nations Environment Programme has said it could take up to 30 years to clean up the pollution that Shell and other oil companies have caused

⚖️ In 1995 Shell was implicated in a court case that resulted in the execution of 9 activists who led a peaceful campaign against Shell’s exploitation of the Ogoniland in the Niger Delta. Shell has been accused of bribing and coaching witnesses, as well as providing false evidence during the court case. The families of the Ogoni 9 have been looking for justice in courts around the world for 2 decades now

📣 Recently, a court in Hague has decided to hear the case brought forward by 4 of the Ogoni 9 widows to decide whether Shell was complicit in their execution. 

⚠️OUR DEMANDS in solidarity with the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People

1️⃣We demand - that Shell pays reparations to communities impacted by environmental and human rights abuses, especially the Ogoni people of the Niger Delta whose land Shell has been forcefully destroying for decades 

2️⃣We demand - that the Government excludes Shell from all climate negotiations and policy making processes, bans government lobbying by fossil fuel companies, ends tax breaks for oil and gas, and excludes fossil fuel investment from Covid 19 recovery plans

3️⃣We demand - that Shell stops exploration for new oil and gas and begin the rapid process of ending fossil fuel extraction

#CivilDisobedience series Part 3/3: 

🛑 SAW ACTIONS

Distrusting business-as-usual

📏 SIT-IN
By using the body to resist and respond to violence and social injustice, protesters literally embody their cause. By remaining completely passive, protestors can maintain the moral political superiority of appearing in control rather than out of order—a control that make the protests noteworthy, emotionally effective, and relatable. By refusing to move, the protesters exert a subtle control over everyone’s actions.

📏 DIE-IN
Die-ins resonate with meaning beyond mere non-compliance. By behaving as if dead, protesters not only use their bodies to obstruct potential police action: They bring the issue of death front and center for observers. They provoke everyone in the vicinity to contemplate how one body can and should care compassionately for another.

📏 LOCK-ON
Let’s approach the body as a vast reservoir of signs and symbols, by envisioning it as capable of both persuasion and strong willed unruliness. A body in action is not only an instrument of expression, but also proof that something can be done.
Everyone in a lock-on feels locked in, but can be set free.

📏 GLUE-ON
""I believe that truth is the glue that holds government together, not only our government, but civilization itself.""Where governments do not provide that glue, civilians themselves can make the truth stick to the public’s consciousness.",NA,NA,NA,1.06

🎨 BRUSH ACTIONS: 

Creating a counterculture!

Brush-Actions are all about creating a counterculture and placing disobedient art in public.

🖌️ PAINT THE STREETS
Painting the streets is a vehicle of resistance, a symbolic act, creating the substance of the “volcanic eruptions of protest”! It achieves its goal when it touches the conscience of viewers through challenging the current social and political order. Street art, to be effective, must be disruptive, thought-provoking!

🖌️ GUERILLA GARDENING
“A weed is a plant that has mastered every survival skill except for learning how to grow in rows.” Activists can fertilize the ground for change: sow seeds, plant weeds and wild flowers all over the city. The atmosphere will thank them.

🖌️ GUERILLA THEATRE
“Guerrilla theatre can be considered as a ‘social technology’ – as a complex of fluid, experimental and developing forms through which the concrete meaning of new social forms, of community (directly in terms of the organization and interplay of the senses) can become more fully conscious in both image and practice.”

🖌️ BANNER ACTION
“Thought is the blossom; language the bud; action the fruit behind it.”

A witty slogan in a clever place is like offering a fruit basket to society.

🖌️ REVERSE GRAFFITI
“Reverse Graffiti is the process of cleaning specific areas of dirty pavements or walls which creates art or advertising through the contrast of clean and dirty sections.” There is something satisfying about cleaning away the dirt and have a pure and clean message appear amidst it.",NA,NA,NA,1.41

#CivilDisobedience series Part 1/3:

📣 MEGAPHONE ACTIONS 

Evoking attention!

📢 PUBLIC AGITATION
“That’s exactly the purpose of civil disobedience: to upset people, to trouble them, to disturb them. We who commit civil disobedience are disturbed, too, and we mean to disturb those who are in charge […].”
(Howard Zinn)

📢 CALL FOR BOYCOTT
Boycott is not a principle, it is a tactic depending upon circumstances. A tactic which allows people, as distinct from their elected but often craven governments, to apply a certain pressure on those wielding power in what they, the boycotters, consider to be an unjust or immoral way.
(John Berger)

📢 GUERILLA SOUNDS
“There is no noise as powerful as the marching feet of a determined people.” It’s impossible to close ones ears to a city flooded with sounds and music.
(Martin Luther King)

“Music has the power to break through barriers, and right now we really need to break through some barriers if we are to face this emergency.”

It’s impossible to close ones ears to a city flooded with sounds and music.

📢 LIGHT DISPLAY
Projections mark a new way to bring protest messages to the public in an accessible way. A large-scale projection, transforms space, and it creates a kind of temporary venue to have these conversations. “Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that.""

📢 SWARMING
Swarming activists block traffic for a few minutes to inform about their cause, retreat, and then advance – again and again. From the point of view from the bee, every flower needs pollinating.",NA,NA,NA,1.2

bio to find out how you can support Goa. 

🌑 Over 5,000 people gathered at the South Western railway line in Goa, near the level crossing at Chandor, from 10:30 PM, until 4AM. The South Western Railway (SWR) was scheduled to proceed with the track doubling near the same crossing, during the late night hours 2nd November. 

💪 Braving the threat of Covid and late night dew, people representing various citizen and environmental groups, political parties and age groups showed up, determined to occupy the tracks until dawn. This risky move was the last resort, after the government and Railway had refused to respond to requests to scrap the project from several people's led movements rallying around this, and other linked issues (of disastrous ecological and social impact), regarding a steady plan to turn Goa into a coal hub. 

🗣️ Amidst speeches, announcements and even a folk dance performance, the infectious, rallying beats of a dhol-tasha band filled the air. The crowd kept growing from 10:30 onwards, and echoes of steely resolve and impassioned discontent filled the air. 

🚂 Chants of ""Goans don't want coal!"", ""Kick out Adani, Jindal Sterlite"" and ""Wake up Goans!"" were regularly heard in Konkani, Hindi and English. People settled down along either side of the railway tracks, which was ablaze with as many candles as there were protestors. 

⏱️ At some point after midnight, the Deputy Collector, Margao, arrived  to inform the protestors that they would be suspending all double tracking. The people demanded the Collector's order be issued in writing. Opposition to the South Western Railway has been going on for years, since as early as 2016.

⚡️ ""The exploitation of natural resources and the climate is inextricably linked with the exploitation of minority groups, including women.

The same way of thinking is responsible for both phenomena, based on the belief that man (traditionally a white man) dominates nature.

⚡️ “Caring for the environment comes from caring for human communities and this must go hand in hand. Respect for other people is combined with respect for beings who we do not recognize as human subjects. ""

Fighting for the climate is fighting for women's rights.
On Monday, together with @strajk_kobiet, we protested against the inhumane verdict of the Constitutional Tribunal. We are a wave of change. 👏

Downing Street, Westminster

BLOOD OF OUR CHILDREN
DOWNING STREET
MARCH 2019 

In March 2019 Extinction Rebellion UK poured blood outside Downing Street to sound the alarm on the climate and ecological emergency

This government continues to fail young people, they are failing on keeping kids nourished during the pandemic, failing on their future education through the exam results chaos, and failing on inaction on the climate and ecological emergency which puts their future at risk

We don't trust this government to care about our future

We want to see Citizens’ Assemblies play a crucial part in democracy, imagine if a group representative of the population were to decide on young people's education, health, wellbeing, and future

We demand a Citizens’ Assembly now

[LE MONDE À L'ENDROIT] 

This is the action at the Ministry of Ecological Transition in #Paris

👀 When we observe the way in which our rebels were treated during the ""manu militari"" evacuation of the Forces of order while the behavior of the police was non-violent, activists were accused of having ""put up violent resistance [...] by keeping his hands close to his body during the questioning"" 

Every time the Government represses us, we get stronger!

You are not able to prevent our extinction, you will not stop our rebellion ✊

Love and Rage 💜

Suite à l'action au Ministère de la Transition écologique sur #Paris, les 8 Gardé-e-s À Vue sont sortis du commissariat (pour 6 d'entre elleux, au delà des premières 24 heures, parfois jusqu'à 31h de garde à vue).
👀 Quand nous observons la manière dont nos rebelles ont été traité-e-s pendant l'évacuation ""manu militari"" des Forces De l'Ordre alors que le comportement des militant-e-s était non-violent, on ne peut que s’interroger sur les motifs de leur Garde À Vue mentionnés dans le Procès Verbal (voir photo) 🤔

Il est en effet reproché aux activistes d'avoir ""opposé une résistance violente [...] en maintenant ses mains près de son corps lors de l'interpellation et en se jetant délibérément au sol"" 🤦

Chaque fois que le Gouvernement nous réprime, nous devenons plus fort-e-s !
Vous n’êtes pas capable d’éviter notre extinction, vous n’arrêterez pas notre rébellion ✊

Amour, rage & #RebellionMaintenant

.
Through direct non-violent actions, a meeting was held that tried to make visible the forest loss in the great natural regions of the country.
.
☣️ On the one hand, the vast tropical forests that make up the Colombian Amazon could become savanna ecosystems because of the fires this year.
🍃 Let us remember that the Colombian Amazon comprises 41% of the national territory and is home to unique vegetation, biodiversity, and cultural wealth.
☣️However, due to deforestation burns (they have been the worst in a decade), it is being destroyed along with the Peruvian, Bolivian, Ecuadorian and Brazilian Amazon.
.
☣️Additionally, more than 160 hectares of native forest in the Colombian Caribbean are threatened by fires and burns for the land grabbing of extensive cattle ranching and the planting of African palm monocultures.
.
⌛ Current statistics and data confirm the most critical scenarios to face the Climate crisis. We are on the brink of environmental collapse!
.
We need to continue acting through direct non-violent actions so that, among all of us, we can raise our voices and mobilize against extractivist policies and decrees.
.
What else has to happen for governments and large industries to act in the face of an imminent crisis? We need to integrate and sympathize with the struggles of indigenous, peasant, Afro and environmental movements that have historically been committed to environmental and social struggles, and together be part of the solution by turning this situation around.

We announce this great action on the street and invite you to join this rebellion for life.

We want to thank @artesinpausa for joining us and supporting us in this action.

Dehydration, extreme heat stroke or respiratory failure are some of the causes of death related to the climate crisis that are already occurring today.

With this action carried out on October 11 in Barcelona, ​​Granada, Valencia, Santander, Ibiza, Malaga, Cádiz and Murcia we wanted to show the past, present and future victims of the climate crisis.

In the words of the scientist of the Higher Council for Scientific Research (CSIC) Fernando Valladares: «Climate change kills. This year, about a quarter of a million people will die directly, but the figure rises to tens of millions if we include indirect causes.

In Cádiz and Murcia, the action has been carried out by #XRSanidad. The defense of the climate and biodiversity is the defense of health. Our lives are at stake and we want to live. That is why we rebel.

To explain why, here are some extracts from the letter sent to the Minister of Economic Development Stefano Patuanelli:

""Dear Minister Patuanelli,

We chained and chained to Eni's gates. Our mode of action is always radically nonviolent, even in communication, but we cannot remain silent in the face of political inaction towards Eni's “green turn”. Our interlocutors are not companies, which inevitably pursue a short-term private interest, but those who intend to guide our company towards far-sighted decisions aimed at guaranteeing the well-being of citizens.

In recent years, the appeals of scientists appointed to study the ecological and climate crisis by the governments themselves are increasingly dramatic, [...] Even those who, like us, had never found themselves carrying out such strong protests are realizing the gravity of the incipient emergency and the ten-year inaction of governments around the world, not least the Italian one. For this reason we have made a choice out of the ordinary, from our everyday lives, resisting the instinct for self-protection that all and all of us obviously feel. [...]

We ask you to come to us and talk about Eni and the choices that this government must make to protect those it has chosen to represent, so we can free ourselves from these chains. We would like to discuss with you how to prevent this Business As Usual from continuing, which now looks like a blind dance on the edge of a precipice.

We will wait for you here
With Love and Anger. """,NA,NA,NA,5.5

It is a shame that such actions have to take place, but the policy of the federal government leaves us with nothing else - at the moment it is driving us straight into the climate catastrophe.

Chaining at Andi: XR blocks the Ministry of Transport🔗💚

⚠️Around 80 activists from the Extinction Rebellion movement have been blocking the entrances to the Federal Ministry of Transport since 6.15 a.m. and demanding that the Dannenröder forest be cleared immediately under the motto #WaldstattAsphalt.

🌳With the peaceful action, we call on Minister of Transport Andreas Scheuer and Prime Minister Angela Merkel to stop the destruction of ecosystems such as the Dannenröder Forest immediately.

⚖️Furthermore, @extinctionrebelliondeutschland calls for a citizens' assembly to be called to work out a climate and socially just transport transition.

❌Despite the climate catastrophe and the collapse of our forests, the Ministry of Transport, under Andreas Scheuer, supports the clearing of a healthy mixed forest for the construction of another motorway, although we need the traffic turnaround right now.

Parts of the 300 year old Dannenröder forest have been cleared for the construction of the A49 motorway since October 1st.

- with blockades at the Ministry of Transport, the Ministry of Agriculture by @animalrebellion_germany, a funeral march of the dead trees through Berlin and a vigil at Invalidenpark. Determined, disobedient, colorful and corona-compliant, we demanded from politicians: # Stop the destruction of our livelihoods!

On the 5th of September the Indonesian People’s Representative Council (DPR) passed the controversial *omnibus bill* on job into law despite mounting opposition to the bill over its feared impact on the environment and labor rights. Even global investors, whom the bill targets, warn the Indonesian government that the jobs bill puts business activities at risks due to some articles in the bill that would undermine global action to tackle biodiversity loss and slow climate breakdown. 

People in Indonesia have decided to take it down to the streets and were met with tear gas. Over 500 people got detained, the situation for all workers is extremely scary right now. Third image: A protester waving the Indonesian flag behind a banner that says ""Vote of no confidence, revolution is the solution"" on Oct 8, 2020. (Photo: Nivell Rayda) @channelnewsasia

Not to mention, some of the bill’s provisions would also directly increase the risk of massive deforestation by eliminating existing legal protections for primary forest cover.

Assesment from Madani, a local environment NGO, warns that this bill could lead to the complete destruction of natural forest cover in the provinces of Riau, Jambi, South Sumatra, Bangka Belitung and Central Java over the next two to three decades.

Forests of Indonesia are the third largest tropical forests in the world. This is a catastrophic climate damaging bill that will have dire consequences to the whole world. 

The government of Indonesia need to repeal the Omnibus Law on Job Creation since it endangers the environment and will intensify the ongoing violation of the environment, workers and Indigenous Peoples’ rights.

As youth, fighting for the planet, we've always got to remember that even as 5% of the world's population, indigenous people protect 80% of global biodiversity and are on the front lines of climate crisis.

According to International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Sinharaja is Sri Lanka's last viable area of primary tropical rainforest. More than 60% of the trees are endemic and many of them are considered rare. 

Since first week of August, a road is being constructed through Sinharaja National Reserve Forest. The road construction work goes on buffer zone of the rainforest in the Lankagama area to Deniyaya. Although building infrastructure is important for development we have to be mindful of how these construction impacts our environment and the consequences of such development in the long run. Especially when a road is being constructed through a rainforest which is also recognised as a Biosphere Reserve and World Heritage Site by UNESCO; it should be mandatory to follow the due process and do necessary assessments to find out the impacts it would have on such a pristine ecosystem.

However, it’s reported that this construction is happening with no necessary approvals from relevant authorities such as Department of Forest Conservation (DFC), Central Environment Authority (CEA) and Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC). No Environment Impact Assessments (EIA) or a study has been conducted while Divisional Secretariats and other regulatory bodies were unaware of this project. 

Urbanization of these villages will not only pose threats to rare and endemic flora and fauna inside the rainforest, it will also increase the already worsening Human-Wildlife conflicts. 

We urge President @gotabayar to put an end to this destruction immediately and the authorities to take necessary action before we lose this unique and pristine ecosystem. The Sinharaja Forest Reserve is not only a heritage of the Sri Lankan people, but a heritage of the world.

The Kayapó indigenous community currently faces a deadly threat - its elderly, who have the wisdom of resilience, climate adaptation and culture in their communities, are losing their lives due to COVID-19. They need urgent international support for medical supplies.

The spread of the human-ignited forest fires is now also greatly damaging the lives of the Kayapo! The magnitude of fires is vast and it is now damaging the respiratory systems of the community and devastating the ecosystem and wildlife. Climate change is not tomorrow. It is the reality of today! 

We ask that you stand by the Kayapó community and send a clear message of thanks for the service provided to humanity: link in bio to donate ‼️

Their contribution to the protection of the Amazon rainforest, at the service of the whole world, is crucial for humanity to survive the climate and ecological collapse that our Western way of life has brought to our planet. 

Its ancient culture includes carefully designed dance ceremonies with representative body painting patterns that encapsulate its cosmology. Its territory is part of the Ecotone Ecological Corridor in the South of the Amazon, which houses jaguars and ozelots!

In addition to fighting a pandemic, which painfully resembles the way their people were killed by disease during colonization, they are fighting for their rights. Once again, indigenous people are having to mobilize to gather the support and resources they need to survive. 

The Brazilian government's inability to respect its ancestral cultures shows how the legacy of racism and colonization continues to harm the less represented people in South America and the world today. 

450 years of struggle have shown how the resilience and determined spirit of indigenous peoples are fundamental to their ongoing struggle. We are in debt to their integrity, respect and love for their ecosystems and future generations. If we want to learn, it is our time to contribute and stand alongside them now!",NA,NA,NA,3.83

Bats have been shown to host immune systems that are perpetually primed to mount defenses against viruses, viral infections then lead to a swift response that walls the virus out of cells. In simpler words, it protect the bats from getting infected with high viral loads but it also encourages these viruses to reproduce more quickly, increasing their risk of jumping to another species where the viruses will quickly overwhelm their new hosts, leading to high fatality rates. Humans are not spared. This makes bats a unique reservoir of rapidly reproducing and highly transmissible viruses. Disrupting bat habitat appears to stress the animals and makes them shed even more virus in their saliva, urine and feces that can infect other animals.

Natural habitat destruction, extreme pressure and stress imposed on wild animals, wildlife trafficking, live animals markets, atrocious farms animals living conditions... have consequences and we have just started to pay the price.

The Covid-19 pandemic is a wake up call and as we are asked to stay home it is time for reflexion. Where is our morality and ethic hiding? Is it the world we want? It is time to be serious.

More than 500 pairs of shoes which have been sent from rebels all over Indonesia represented the voices of those demanding for Indonesia to be free from the climate crisis. The impacts of climate change due to the continual increase of global temperature have placed us in a critical point. This strike serves as both a warning and a demand for the government to declare a climate emergency 

This action is part of a whole campaign that XR Indonesia did in the month of August, which is widely celebrated as the month in which Indonesia declared its independence, revolving around how Indonesia as a country needs to be free from the climate crisis as well.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic health crisis which has not been resolved in Indonesia, we feel that it is not yet entirely safe for the people to take to the streets and voice their aspirations. The shoes that were gathered voluntarily during a period of 10 days symbolize the voice of the people, and they will be donated to several foundations in need. This shoe strike represents the hope for a livable earth, and it demands freedom from the climate crisis. This strike was conducted while adhering to strict health protocols.

Taking a step back from the horrible pandemic currently affecting the world, the climate crisis is still an existential threat to the human race. The appearance of a new crisis does not make another crisis disappear. We have little time left and actions need to be taken now""

They join to claim a referendum about the agroindustrial model.

This year thousands of square kilometers were burned due to the combined action of a sustained dryout and fires used for land cleaning to prepare the land for livestock, agri-business and real state development.

In Buenos Aires, the capital of Argentina, police acted violently and detained two environmental activists without cause. All of the activists who were present responded nonviolently by holding a sit-in, clapping and singing songs to protest the arrests. An hour later the police released the detained activists.

Newly formed grassroots protest movement Ocean Rebellion launching today has taken to the seas with an escalating series of non-violent actions against The World luxury apartment cruise liner, currently moored in Falmouth Harbour.

Engagement with The World is the first of many actions designed to illuminate the processes of ocean degradation and shift stakeholders from ocean harm to ocean repair.

The World is directly responsible for melting over 200,000 square meters of sea ice each year rendering polar bears homeless, and bringing them to the brink of extinction.

Sophie Miller of Extinction Rebellion Falmouth, said “The oceans are the lungs of the world, it creates our weather and life on the planet began there. And yet many of us have a real disconnect from it now. I feel it’s so important to create and participate in actions like these to raise awareness and to engage people in a wider conversation about the seas and our future. With the melting of the Greenland ice shelf and the fact we are currently on track to significantly overshoot 1.5 degrees of warming, this is more important than ever.
“We also need to be aware that those in the global South are currently on the front line and are already experiencing the disastrous effects of this disconnect. Communities are suffering. People are dying and this is going to get worse unless we act now. I’m just human and a mother who wants a habitable planet",NA,NA,NA,3.09

These marvellous creatures are deemed as the “human of the forest” in that we share nearly 97% of the same DNA. How amazing is that! You could say that they are human's closest relatives.

Sadly Orangutans are today an endangered species due to massive deforestation and illegal hunting in the forests where they live, their numbers are constantly diminishing. Our human lack of awareness about our interdependency with nature is killing people, planet and the life-forms that we share this Earth with. 

So, today, join hands, give a shout out and show some love for our dear close relatives as their populations are at serious risk. Let’s make a change before it’s too late!

That’s why we’re stepping up with @orangutanalliance and joining the #MySteptoProtect challenge! 

Our step to protect is to empower rebels all around the world to engage in civil disobedience and ask their governments to TELL THE TRUTH, ACT NOW and create CITIZENS ASSEMBLIES. 

Words by @orangutanalliance: 

Raise your voice for those who can’t through the Orangutan Alliance #MyStepToProtect challenge. To take part simply share a post of something that you do that’s eco-friendly and tag 3 friends to join the movement!

🌱If you choose to, you can take it one step further by purchasing one of our limited edition Orangutan Alliance soaps. For every soap purchased a tree will be planted in an area protecting critically endangered species.

The most affected were those of the Brazilian Amazon: the largest forest in the world registered a dramatic increase in the number of fires that occurred this year. Brazil captured world attention, but it was not the only country where forests and jungles were burned. In Peru, Colombia, Costa Rica, Bolivia, Mexico and Paraguay the fires showed how deforestation has made these ecosystems even more vulnerable.

Deforestation creates the conditions for fires to become more and more frequent.
And this lost of the forest, makes the local climate change , which is drier, and that makes the forests become flammable and susceptible. A rise of just one degree in the local temperature would be catastrophic for the forests.

Directed and animated by Miritte Ben Yitzchak (@miritte_cubicle), voiced by British actress Naomie Harris (@naomieharris), and scored by Brian Eno (@brianeno) it urges us all to ACT NOW before it is too late.

🌱

The new animated short Extinction Emergency, and Why We Must Act Now, is the first of a two-part explainer video series for Extinction Rebellion, focusing on the climate and ecological crisis.

This moving film summarises the planet’s biodiversity loss, runaway consumerism and the ecological crisis that now faces us, and how the consequences will affect millions of lives around the world.

It will be followed by the second part - Climate Change, and Why We Should Panic - which focuses on the climate crisis. Voiced by Keira Knightley (@keiraknightley_official), it explains what’s causing climate change, why governments must enter crisis mode to tackle this issue, and what will happen if we don’t do something about it now.

""It's not just a number. Each indigenous body holds an ancestral enchantment. For each indigenous person who dies, part of our collective history dies too"" - Celia Xakriaba

This is a day of rebellion to sound the alarm on the impact of Covid-19 in Indigenous communities and to raise funds for APIB (Articulation of the Indigenous Peoples of Brazil) to support those affected.

Indigenous people in Brazil are facing unprecedented threats: on top of attacks from government-sanctioned racism, land grabbing and big agribusiness, the Covid-19 mortality rate is higher among indigenous than non-indigenous people. Without the necessary medical help, lives that might otherwise be saved are being lost.

🌳

The climate and ecological crisis sickens and displaces both wild animals and human beings. It creates excellent conditions for pests like ticks and mosquitoes to breed as well as for deadly bacteria to multiply. And it literally thaws ancient pathogens from the ground. 

💥

All of these lead to disease, which, when left unchecked, can result in pandemics. ﻿ 

⚠️

This post explains some of the less-visible connections between infectious disease and the climate and ecological crisis; how many pandemics begin; and how, by fighting against environmental destruction, we can also play a part in preventing the next pandemic. 

🗣️

Pandemics and the environment are inseparable in these 6 ways:

1️⃣ Pandemics Start with Wild Animals:
What are some similarities between COVID-19, SARS, MERS, Ebola, swine flu (H1N1), Lyme disease, West Nile fever, and HIV/AIDS? All of these originated in wildlife before jumping to humans.

2️⃣ Wilderness Is a Wall that Keeps out Disease. We're Destroying It:
Shrinking wilderness and disease outbreaks go hand in hand. Destroying nature sickens wild animals, then brings their contagious diseases to us.

3️⃣ The Climate Crisis Strengthens Existing Diseases:
Warmer temperatures allow bacteria to multiply faster, while extreme weather creates flooding, sewage spillover, and standing pools of water, which all provide prime bacterial breeding grounds.

4️⃣ Air Pollution Weakens Our Defenses:
For COVID-19 sufferers, a small increase in a patient's exposure to air pollution was associated with an 8% higher death rate.

5️⃣ Diseases Will Continue Melting out of Frozen Land:
Pathogens trapped within previously frozen ground – responsible for such diseases as polio, anthrax, smallpox and the Spanish flu – will eventually be released.

6️⃣ We Can Fight Pandemics: 
It's too late to stop the COVID-19 pandemic from happening, but by fighting for the environment, you can be part of the fight against the arrival of the next pandemic.

Funds of all of us invested in destroying our future?
No way! @extinctionrebellionisrael
* Paz oil - the refineries operator in Ashdod.
Fined in 2017 for thick black cloud emissions and cancer.
Harel's investment: 207 million shekels of our pension money.
* Gas group - a whale rig operates for gas production where 35 malfunctions occurred during 4 months.
Harel's investment: 162 million shekels from our pension money.
* Israeli company - activates five of the ten most polluting factories in Israel.
Ariel's investment: 128 million shekels from our pension money.
Stop funding climate criminals! 
Compared to israel, in the world winds of change are felt. In the UK thousands of bodies have diverted investments from the fossil fuel industry in a amount of investments estimated at over $ 14 trillion and even the European Investment Bank has announced to divert fossil fuels investments by 2021.
How is it possible that the pension money of all of us fund exactly what is hurting us? What accelerates the most serious and dangerous crisis that humanity has ever known? This is exactly what our activists came to ask the Harel Investment House this morning.
The activists returned to the investment house the pollution they support and demanded from them - stop investing our funds in polluting bodies and start investing them with renewable energy!
Rebellion activists will continue to visit investment houses until the diversion of investments from fossil fuels begins. See you later 😉✊🌱🌍💪

#LivingRegeneratively understands our lives are interlinked: we are dependant on one another, our actions will affect each other. Protecting and looking after one another is also protecting and looking after ourselves, and doing it for ourselves means doing it for others too.
♾️
Living regeneratively also means engaging with the Climate and Ecological Crisis emotionally. Coming to terms with the gravity of the situation we are in can be an overwhelming experience; sometimes even traumatic. Being able to NAME and IDENTIFY emotions can help in moving through them. Words that articulate states of being and concepts create space for empathy and understanding.
🌸
Sharing with others who get what we’re going through can help us understand the process we’re in; that we’re not alone; and that we’re not crazy or overreacting. By allowing ourselves to be supported and supporting others, we find solidarity, deepen our connections with others, and actively create the more resilient and compassionate world we strive towards.
🐛
Emotions inform our activism too. Feelings will always impact our thinking: it is impossible to think ‘entirely’ rationally- we are human. Emotions inform our understanding of, and affect our reactions to, the world. If we know what feelings we are acting and understanding with, we can act more consciously and compassionately, and our decisions will be less ego-driven. It will be easier to be less biased. 
🌊
In our efforts to save the planet and ourselves, we must understand which emotions are driving us. Are my choices coming from fear, hopelessness, despair, panic, apathy, hope, love, empathy, calm or compassion? Maybe all of them at different times? How are these feelings impacting my activism?

BP is no ordinary oil company: their security guards secretly spy on the local community members while the armed Indonesian security forces are stationed at BP’s base. 
While we feature West Papua in the Southeast & East Asia week, we believe and recognize them as Pacific islanders who should be free from Indonesian control. We must fight for their basic human rights and free them from the oppression that they face!

Extinction Rebellion offers our unconditional support and solidarity to all trans people in the face of unrelenting attacks from Trans-Exclusionary-Radical-Feminists, the media, elected politicians, and even from leading voices within the environmental movement. 
We do not believe that the existence of trans people, or the clearly documented oppression and abuse they experience is a topic that should be up for debate.

Trans women are women. Trans men are men. Non-binary and all other gender expressions which do not conform to the gender that person is assigned at birth are valid, legitimate, and true. This is not up for debate.
Ultimately, transphobic rhetoric legitimises both structural and personal violence against trans people.
We state loudly and clearly: Trans liberation is intrinsic and inseparable from the liberation of all of humanity. Trans comrades are at the front and centre of our struggles, and long may they remain so.

Rainforests are threatened by deforestation, fires and profit-seeking policies that seek to undermine the ecological services they provide for life on Earth
🔥⚠️
Tropical rainforests store about 25% of the Earth’s carbon. Just in the Amazon basin, around 90-140 billion tons of carbon are stored, equivalente to 9-14 decades of human carbon emissions (Yale’s Global Forest Atlas). Their role in mitigating climate change cannot be ignored
🚫🌳
Deforestation and slash-and-burn techniques are used to clear the forests for mining, farming or cattle ranching. Clearing not only produces emissions, but “triggers major shifts in rainfall and increased temperatures worldwide that are just as potent as those caused by current carbon pollution (ClimateFocus)”🔬
☠️⛔
When talking about the protection of the forests, it is crucial that we highlight the Forests’ Protectors: Indigenous communities. Indigenous communities all over the world protect 80% of global biodiversity (National Geographic), and the lands they manage have equal-or-higher biodiversity than protected areas (Environmental Science & Policy)
🦋🌱
The role of indigenous communities in protecting, sustaining and enriching the biodiversity of the rainforests must be a priority in efforts to preserve the role of these ecosystems for the global climate system
🌿🌸
Swipe to listen directly from Odette from the Baka Indigenous community in the Congo basin, from Olimpio Santos Wiramu from the Gajajara in the Amazon, and from Tainaky Tenetehar from the Guajajara, videos by @survivalinternational
🦜🌞
The messages from these Indigenous leaders are loud and clear: any conservation project must take them into account, they need international support and visibility if they are to continue protecting nature for the survival of all life on the planet. We need them and they need us to stand with their cause in #solidarity: donating to fundraisers (link in bio) and educating ourselves on the oppression they face

With the coronavirus spreading into remote territories across the Brazilian Amazon, indigenous leaders and rights officials are pleading with the government to adopt urgent measures to head off a catastrophe.
According to figures compiled by the Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil ( @apiboficial ), the country’s principal indigenous federation, deaths from COVID-19 in indigenous communities have risen from 46 on May 1 to 262 on June 9. Together with numbers tallied by state health departments around the country, APIB’s statistics show that 9.1 percent of indigenous people who contract the disease are dying, nearly double the 5.2 percent rate among the general Brazilian population. The growing number of cases and the government’s sluggish response have prompted allegations of incompetence and disarray in official efforts to protect vulnerable tribal populations from contagion. Indeed, government health-care workers, together with illegal mineral prospectors and other intruders, now figure among the principal vectors of infection into protected indigenous territories. A report released last week by the federal attorney general’s office accused a team of health workers of “flagrant negligence” and decried the likelihood that government nurses and technicians had spread the virus among the very indigenous populations they’re supposed to protect. #ActForAmazonia @oxygenseven @global_wildlife_conservation @apiboficial",NA,NA,NA,-1.51

The SOS Amazônia campaign is an initiative coming from Brazilian and international activists, created with the goal of helping traditional communities of the Amazonian territory battle Covid-19. Through collective international funding, we hope to raise 1 million Reais (about 195000 USD) to purchase of basic hygiene, food and health items. This action plans to benefit regions such as the city of Manaus and its surroundings and rural parts of the Amazonas state.
The health system in Manaus, the capital of the state of Amazonas and the main reference health center for most of the Amazon Rainforest's traditional peoples, has collapsed. As a consequence, millions of peoples' lives were put at risk. The city's press officers have announced over 100 deaths per day due to Covid-19, and this number can be higher with the addition of non-confirmed cases. We need to help both the rural and urban populations to contain the spread of the virus and therefore avoid the destruction of the heart of the Amazon.
The climate emergency is our generation's biggest challenge. It is a path of no return towards the extinction of all society across the planet that we must avoid. The mass deaths of the Amazon's peoples, especially the native peoples, will be a loss with global consequences.
The contributions can be made by people from any country through the sosamazonia.fund website. The raised resources will be managed by a committee composed by us and FAS representatives. Throughout the routing of funds, we will inform
everyone what is being purchased and which communities will benefit, maintaining transparency.
Help us to act NOW!

Oceans are one of the priorities we need to look after if we are to survive as a species. 70% of the Earth is made up of oceans, more than half of the world's oxygen is created by phytoplanktons in the ocean. The oceans absorb 1/4th of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that is released into the atmosphere, which in turn makes it more acidic, threatening the survival of marine life 🐟🦀🐡🦐🐠🐙 As a global society, we acknowledge that people play a major role in this restoration of our oceans- only when we come together can we achieve great goals like this. Let us take this day, and all days to come, to be conscious of the waste we produce, as a 10% of it ends up in the oceans. And more importantly, let’s take the day to recognize that protecting the oceans is protecting people: half of the world, 3.5 billion people, depend on the ocean for their primary source of food. 
The theme of 2020 is Innovation for a Sustainable Ocean. To do so, we need to understand all that has gone wrong in having sustainable oceans in the first place. and move ahead from there. As long as there is a will, there will be a way 💙💙💙 All we need to do is #ActNow.

As an organisation Extinction Rebellion stands in solidarity with those most vulnerable in the face of the climate crisis. The climate crisis, however, is not a single issue; it is a result of colonial powers, inequalities, destruction of nature and communities in the name of profit, and silencing those who have tried to go against this system.⁣
⁣
This is where the silence ends. This is where we must scream louder than ever.⁣
⁣
The Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement is not a trend to follow only when everyone is posting about it online; it is a movement that should force us to do better, work harder and research further every day.⁣

If you have privilege, use it; if you think you don’t know enough to comment, ask & learn. ⁣

We welcome this conversation as a chance for #XR to grow and listen to the courageous truth speakers who are bringing their messages to us:
🗣️💬
Stephen Corry, the esteemed and much respected director of @SurvivalInternational, will talk to us about the early #colonial history of conservation/national park movement from 1860s-1920s.
📚
Mordecai Ogada, a powerful grassroots activist and speaker from Kenya, will give background to the Kenyan history of conservation 1950s - present.
🇰🇪
Fiore Longo, one of Survival International's campaigners based in the Congo, will talk about the brutal ways mainstream conservation is perpetuating colonial #genocide right now in the Congo.
🌳
We'll then welcome questions from the audience and invite the speakers to respond with their unique viewpoints, experiences and knowledge. This is a chance to learn from and engage with some of the world's leading figures fighting for justice in #conservation - don't miss this opportunity!
👀❓
This event is hosted by both XR Youth Solidarity team UK and XRISN - and is backed by those teams as a direct challenge to @ExtinctionRebellion, a challenge to go deep into the dark histories and presents of conservation; to uncover the bloody secrets buried there and to work to banish them in solidarity with the true freedom fighting peoples of the world!

We make use of our first principle, and declare ourselves anti-racist, because our shared vision of change depends on upholding #intersectionalenvironmentalism, identifying and acting on how injustices and violence against oppressed communities and the Earth are interconnected and inextricable. Intersectionality is a necessity if we are to create a world that is fit not only for generations to come, but fit for those that are being oppressed right now. 🌎🌍🌏
We make use of our fourth principle to openly challenge ourselves and our toxic system, and pledge to do the work to dismantle and challenge racism, as well as supporting the inspiring resistance against racism, within our individual, local, national and global contexts.
🆘
We make use of our fifth principle to value learning and reflecting  as we commit to proactively undertake the emotional and intellectual labour to learn about the colonial history and the violent present of environmental and social injustices against Black, Indigenous and POC.
📚 
We make use of our seventh principle to actively mitigate for power within the environmental movement and amplify the messages of Black, Indigenous and POC activists and environmental leaders. We will not remain silent and complicit in the violence against the Black community during this pivotal moment. We stand in solidarity.

💢This proposed “development” plan would only serve the interests of the elites, both nationally and internationally, who will directly benefit from it at the expense of local communities and generations to come!! 🤑 *
☝🏿Not only this, but it also disregards the historical injustices that created NNP where local #Maasai #pastoralist communities were forcibly removed from their lands, or coerced to give it up under the promise of it being for the sole objective of “#conservation” *
🌞It ignores the #IndigenousKnowledge through which wildlife has been conserved over thousands of years! Noting that 65% of Kenya’s #wildlife exists outside the #protectedareas and are best conserved by these communities. *
🌿All this must be acknowledged and the memory and cultural practices honoured by keeping the communities closer to the park. 🥀Any damage to the park will cause cultural and psychological damage to the community who call this place home and have very important cultural and social values attached to this land. *
👣They have lived in these plains since time immemorial and ensured its conservation through cultural and social bonds, and traditional practices that centred on certain wildlife species, which ensured that conservation principles became part of their way of life and this must be honoured. *

Due to exploitation, the Niger Delta suffered a great number of oil spills in a short time period.

The indegenous group, the Ogoni people, had to endure this as they were silenced and were stripped of their land rights.

Although the Ogoni people tried to take matters into their own hands and stand up for what was right, everything possible was done to shut them up and make use of the land.

We are at a point in time where it is not too late to take back the rights and land that we're wrongfully and violently taken from the Ogoni people. They should be heard and not silenced. 🌿✊🏽✊🏽 #ShellMustFall #PollutersOut #DefendTheDefenders @pollutersoutafr @pollutersout @fff.digital

Their security and safety is being actively ignored by the Brazilian government whose negligence is currently resulting in large scale illegal forest destruction as well as posing a threat to the survival of the indigenous of Brazil. 😷

The Guarani Yvyrupa commission has asked those who believe in their struggle for funds to buy food and hygiene items, to ensure the protection and survival of their communities. ✊

And the world has responded! 125 people from all over the world have donated and so far £4000 has been raised!!! 🌍

This will enable 200 families to purchase food, hygiene equipment and safely isolate without the threat of contagion. A massive thank you to everyone for your contributions. The money raised will ensure the guardians of the Atlantic forest can continue defending their home and the Brazilian eco-system. 🌳🌳 However, the Guaraní are still at great risk. There is still a growing need for vital supplies to ensure families can stay safe and isolate, as the grasp of the virus deepens in Brazil. 🙏

We are currently halfway to our goal of reaching £8000 which will protect and support 400 families!! A donation of £20 will ensure one family can safely isolate and protect themselves during this pandemic. However, any amount you can donate will go a long way to not only ensure the safety, survival and way of life of the Guaraní but also their ability to protect the Brazilian ecosystem: a lifeline for all humanity and the planet in the current ecological crisis 💜💜 Link to donate: https://www.chuffed.org/project/solidarity-guarani-community-in-brazil 🌱

Even though the world is going through a pandemic, the Brazilian government has been trying to pass a bill that would allow and empower land-grabbers to continue destroying the Amazon, threatening the climate and biodiversity, and the lives of hundreds of thousands of Indigenous Peoples.
But after pressure from the public, members of parliaments and companies around the globe, the Brazilian congress postponed the vote on the bill.
It’s not over, but the world is watching. 👀

Tell The Truth

Mounting death tolls starkly illustrate what happens when those in power ignore scientists. Government officials have failed to protect all of us, especially those most vulnerable. Covid-19 and the climate crisis disproportionately impact communities of color. We are facing an unprecedented global emergency that could have been prevented, and can no longer be denied. It is time to tell the truth. ⁠⠀

The Elders still mourn remembering these stories, the cries of the children impregnating the memory and the body. The complicity between those in power still remains to this day. Violence is one of the tools through which racism and colonialism are expressed in denying the right to self-determination of Indigenous Peoples.

‘Hello again, Global Leaders. Last year, we were marching in the streets of the world, reporting the climate emergency. We have listened to promises of a better world and a sustainable society. Now we came back to talk with you. Manaus is the capital of the Brazilian Amazonas state, and, along with Belem do Pará, it is the heart of the Amazon Rainforest. Manaus is an almost remote area, without national visibility in Brazil. Its health system collapsed, and we are not even at the peak of the pandemic. The Town Hall has announced over 100 deaths per day due to Covid-19, and this number can be higher with the non-notified cases. The public authorities in the heart of the Amazon Rainforest are asking for help: we ask the developed countries with already recovered health systems, please, have mercy, and help us avoid the mass death of the Amazon population. Manaus is asking for medical equipment, qualified people, volunteers and attention. As everyone knows, the climate emergency is our generation’s biggest challenge. It is a path of no return that leads to the extinction of society in all countries, all continents. The high death rate of the Amazon people, in the traditional communities, will be a loss with global consequences. More than ever, deforestation is growing in the Amazon, which will soon reach a point of no return.’ .

Our planet is currently experiencing a climate and ecological emergency, where human economic activity has already pushed our global ecosystem to the brink of collapse. ☠️ Being only 0.4% of indigenous peoples worldwide, indigenous communities in Brazil defend and preserve 20% of the Earth's #biodiversity. Indigenous communities have been, and still remain, the last barrier of defence against the loss of biodiversity and collapse of ecosystems. 🍃 
Centuries of exploitation, violence and displacement from their ancestral lands have left the Guariní exposed and vulnerable to the effects of the #Pandemic. 🆘 
Brazil has the most COVID-19 cases in Latin America. Despite this, the government has left the Guaraní people (the largest indigenous community in Brazil) without protection or help. 😷 
Supporting indigenous communities is not an act of charity but an act of solidarity with their resistance: for the global ecosystem to survive they have to win this fight against the virus. 🦠 
If we want to survive the climate crisis, we must stand in solidarity with indigenous people during this pandemic! ⚖️ The Guaraní Commission Yvyrupa, one of the largest indigenous organisations in the world, is asking for financial support from those who believe in their struggle to protect the forests. This will enable them to buy basic food and hygiene items without risking contagion by leaving their communities. 🦜

A federal judge handed down a major victory for the Standing Rock Sioux tribe of North Dakota on Wednesday, ruling that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers violated the National Environmental Policy Act by approving federal permits for the Dakota Access Pipeline.
The USACE must complete a full environmental impact study of the pipeline, including full consideration of concerns presented by the Standing Rock Tribe, the judge ruled. The tribe has asked the court to ultimately shut the pipeline down.

In the midst of the corona virus pandemic, Greek people are in a mandatory lockdown and the parliament is functioning with less than 10% of its MPs present, and thus unable to conduct a just democracy. At the end of April, the Greek government will try to pass a new law disgracefully named ''Modernization of the Environmental Legislation'' that effectively withdraws environmental regulations so that new ''investments'' can be made that will undoubtedly destroy the country's and subsequently the Earth's environment for the sake of short-term profit. We are witnessing the demolition of the democracy as this health crisis being treated as an opportunity by the right-wing neo-liberal government. And we need to act now.
🌎
This bill promotes hydrocarbon mining and withdraws regulations for oil and gas extraction while companies like Total, Repsol, Exxon-Mobil and Edison have been awarded licenses in 2018 to drill a sea area of 60.000 square kilometers that equals 30% of the country's mainland.
🌏
Also, in the making is a new pipeline project, the ‘’Eastern Mediterranean (EastMed)’’ that will transfer natural gas form Israel, through Cyprus, Greece, and into the rest of Europe and strengthen the fossil fuel industry.
🌍
These projects, are taking advantage of Greece's weak financial position that hasn't yet recovered from the 2008 crisis. Through these developments, the E.U. will achieve more energy independence from outside suppliers, thus saving billions of euros and increasing its strategical power. The caveat is that this process, sponsored by powerful EU countries and the fervently capitalist Greek government, will cause a whole country to be environmentally destroyed, inflicting suffering on the Greek people who will not benefit at all from these new sources of non-renewable energy. These happen inside the supposedly progressive E.U. that frequently points the finger at more authoritarian foreign governments, while it's house is burning. Make no mistakes, this is the modernization of colonialism, not of the environmental law.""

Similar to the climate crisis, race and class both play a huge role in this epidemic. Black and brown communities, and the poorest members of society, are often hit the hardest. 📣 📣 📣 ⁣
⁣
For example, in the USA, black Americans are dying in disproportionate numbers. ⁣
⁣
According to @guardian “African Americans face a higher risk of exposure to the virus, mostly on account of concentrating in urban areas and working in essential industries. Only 20% of black workers reported being eligible to work from home, compared with about 30% of their white counterparts, according to the Economic Policy Institute.”⁣

Being only 0.4% of indigenous peoples worldwide, indigenous communities in Brazil defend and preserve 20% of the Earth's #biodiversity. Indigenous communities have been, and still remain, the last barrier of defence against the loss of biodiversity and collapse of ecosystems.
🚧
For this precise reason, the #Guaraní, like many other indigenous peoples, are attacked by a government that does not respect their rights, and wants to destroy their lands for profit. Thus contributing to the acceleration of Climate Change  #StopEcocide #StopGenocide

Supporting #indigenous communities means supporting the health of ecosystems for the whole of humanity! If we want to survive the climate crisis, we must stand in solidarity with indigenous people during this #pandemic.

Impoverished by the destruction of their Atlantic forest, the Guaranì indigenous people do not have enough land or savings to self-isolate and are marginalized in healthcare: the brutal choice they face is between hunger and an even more devastating contagion. ☠️ Brazil, and in particular the South and South-East has had the most #Covid19 cases in Latin America. Therefore, the #Guaraní people, the largest #indigenous people in the region, are asking for our financial support to face the new #coronavirus pandemic. 🦠
To stop a history of genocide from repeating itself, they want to follow the guidelines of health agencies and #selfisolate. However, as well as #Coronavirus, they are worried about hunger. 🌽
In this #emergency, the Guaraní Commission Yvyrupa are asking those who support their struggle and believe in their fight for the protection of the forest to support them financially so they can buy basic food and hygiene items for their families without risking contagion by leaving their communities. ⚖️
We must act in solidarity!

The fate of the Indigenous communities = The fate of Life
👩🏻‍⚖️👨🏻‍⚖️ Indigenous rights are fundamental to the preservation of the global ecosystem and to the survival of humanity. Due to their ecological worldviews and practices, indigenous communities are essential to the health of ecosystems. 🏭

The lie of colonial Western development has destroyed indigenous culture, economic and political independence for centuries. This same mindset of development has polluted our air and water, propelling our civilization towards ecological and climate breakdown. It is time to join in solidarity and resist.
💰

When indigenous communities are dispossessed of their lands, agribusiness and other industrial corporations have destroyed those ecosystems for profit. A third of Earth's soil is already acutely degraded due to industrial agriculture and climate change. ☠️ If the climate and ecological emergency continues to unfold, studies predict a collapse of the human population throughout this century. Indigenous people are not only the most important defense of humanity against the ecological catastrophe, but are also leading climate resilience. 🌀

Indigenous communities' relationship with the environment, based on ancestral spiritual, cultural, social and economic interdependence, gives Indigenous peoples a unique advantage to prepare for and respond to the impacts of climate change and catastrophes.
🌱

Our planet's biodiversity, climate and ecosystem depend on Indigenous people. Protecting their rights in solidarity means protecting the future survival of the human species.

Protecting indigenous rights in Brazil = Protecting the Amazon = Protecting life! 💚
Indigenous people make up just 5% of the world's population yet they protect 80% of Earth’s biodiversity. 🌴
Brazil holds 20% of that biodiversity and 98.5% of Brazilian indigenous territory is in the Amazon, our planet's major carbon sink.
🌳🍃
Right now the fate of indigenous communities in Brazil, and therefore the survival of our ecosystem, is in the hands of the Brazilian legal system. The Brazilian government is trying to strip all indigenous peoples of their current land rights. 🇧🇷
The government aggressively support turning the Amazon into an agribusiness heaven.
🔥
Current trends in livestock, agriculture, logging, fires and droughts,  project that 55% of the Amazon will be destroyed by 2030 if action is not taken.
🚱
Pressure has been ramped up since a far-right government came into power with an ecocidal vision of opening up the Amazon for commercial agriculture, mining and oil and gas extraction. Indigenous land rights are the only thing standing in their way.
👨‍🔬
Scientist Daniel Nepstad says indigenous lands are 'the most important barrier to Amazon deforestation.’ If indigenous communities lose their lands, Brazilian ecosystems will be wiped out to make room for profitable projects.This will turn the Amazon into a savanna, rainfall becoming reserved on a regional scale. This could effectively activate a global ecological collapse. It would also create economic genocide for Indigenous peoples in Brazil.
🇧🇷
Our planet's biodiversity, climate and ecosystem depend on Indigenous peoples. Protecting their rights in solidarity means protecting the future survival of life.
🌍 🌎🌏
The fate of indigenous communities in Brazil = The fate of life. 💚
STOP ECOCIDE!

After a warm and dry winter, the fires are far larger than the typical brush fires in the Chernobyl zone. 
Saturday’s strong winds could spread the fires to the remnants of the nuclear plant and the equipment that was used to clean up the disaster, said Kateryna Pavlova, the acting head of the agency that oversees the area, in a telephone interview. “At the moment, we cannot say the fire is contained”

Over time, radiation has settled into the soil, where its half-life ticks away mostly harmlessly. But the roots of moss, trees and other vegetation have absorbed some radiation, bringing it to the surface and spreading radioactive particles in smoke when it burns. Also, radioactive particles can land on gardens or fields and later be consumed in food .

- .🔥💨 ES: Ya encerrada por el coronavirus, Ucrania ahora también se enfrenta a incendios en el paisaje postapocalíptico de la zona de Chernobyl.

Después de un invierno cálido y seco, los incendios son mucho más grandes que los típicos de matorrales en la zona de Chernobyl.

Pero los fuertes vientos del sábado podrían propagar los incendios a los restos de la planta nuclear y el equipo que se utilizó para limpiar el desastre, dijo Kateryna Pavlova, la directora interina de la agencia que supervisa el área, en una entrevista telefónica. ""Por el momento, no podemos decir que el fuego está contenido""

Con el tiempo, la radiación se ha asentado en el suelo, donde su vida media avanza casi sin causar daño. Pero las raíces de musgo, árboles y otra vegetación han absorbido algo de radiación, llevándola a la superficie y propagando partículas radiactivas en el humo cuando se quema. Además, las partículas radiactivas pueden aterrizar en jardines o campos y luego ser consumidas en los alimentos.

The forest fires have been burning for several weeks amid dry conditions, destroying hundreds of acres of land and taking the lives of people and animals. ⁣
⁣
According to the Bangkok Post, “villagers have to stand at the forefront, reaching the hotspot as fast as they could to put out the blaze because in the eyes of the state they are ""typical culprits"" for fire disasters. But, in fact, they are forest guardians who have dealt with fires every year. They are the ones who help build fire buffer zones.⁣
⁣
Even though the state set up fire fighting stations, the number of officials manning them is limited.⁣
⁣
As the fire fighting continues, small people, for example villagers and a village leader along with low-level rangers, have sacrificed their lives. One forest firefighter committed suicide, leaving a death note that attacked cronyism and bureaucratic red tape that makes fire fighting much tougher. ⁣
⁣
As city people are hit hard during the Covid-19 pandemic, they can still find food in the supermarkets and survive. But it's different for forest dwellers, they will have no access to the forest, their only source of food, sometimes being referred to as a traditional supermarket. And, ironically, they have to take all the blame for the stubborn blazes.”⁣

CORONAVIRUS AND THE CLIMATE CRISIS - THOUSANDS OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLE IN URGENT NEED AFTER EXTREME FLOODS 
As indigenous people in the Ecuadorian Amazon fight to prevent the spread of COVID-19 into their territories, extreme floods on the Bobonaza river have caused bridges to collapse, flooded homes and food gardens  threatening the livelihood of thousands of people.This is the worst flood in recent history, caused by deforestation and climate change. This is the Climate Crisis!

The coronavirus pandemic exacerbates the situation, because government agencies are overrun dealing with the virus outbreak and have little resources to provide emergency help. These communities have no access to basic services, which leaves these indigenous people in an extremely vulnerable situation. 
Indigenous peoples of the Amazon are on the frontlines of climate change, protecting living forests while resisting extraction and other threats They are putting their lives on the line and now they need our SUPPORT! 
All donations will go directly to the affected communities via  AmazonWatch. 
THANK YOU! -

CORONAVIRUS Y LA CRISIS CLIMÁTICA - MILES DE INDÍGENAS CON NECESIDADES URGENTES DESPUÉS DE INUNDACIONES EXTREMAS

Mientras los indígenas en la Amazonía ecuatoriana luchan para prevenir el coronavirus en sus territorios,  inundaciones sin precendentes en el río Bobonaza, en Ecuador, han causado que cientos de familias pierdan sus hogares y también dañen sus cultivos. Escuelas han sido arrazdas. Esta es la peor inundación en la región, causada por el cambio climático y la deforestación. Esto es la crisis climática

La pandemia de coronavirus exacerba la situación, porque las agencias gubernamentales están saturadas atendiendo el brote del virus y tienen pocos recursos para brindar ayuda. Estas comunidades no tienen acceso a servicios básicos, lo que deja a las familias indígenas en una situación extremadamente vulnerable.

Los pueblos indígenas de la Amazonía están luchando contra el cambio climático, arriesgando sus vidas y ahora necesitan nuestro APOYO. 
Todas las donaciones irán directamente a las comunidades afectadas a través de AmazonWatch.",NA,NA,NA,2.08

Necesitamos examinar lo que realmente significan estas ideas, y tener claro que cualquier afirmación de que una pandemia global y la pérdida de miles de vidas humanas es algo bueno para el clima, es mucho más peligroso que el virus en sí.⁣
⁣
Estamos viviendo un momento de mucha incertidumbre y miedo, donde las personas más vulnerables están expuestas a grandes riesgos y la muerte. Cualquier reclamo que ponga la responsabilidad de la crisis climática a los pies de los más marginados, es un paso en el camino hacia el ecofascismo - una ideología progresiva que pisotea a los que se consideran ""menos"" en un intento para ""salvar la tierra"", con sus raíces en el nazismo. Algunos grupos de la extrema derecha han estado posando como Extinción Rebelión para propagar ideas fascistas. Condenamos estas tácticas y rechazamos abiertamente y luchamos contra sus ideas.⁣
⁣
El cambio climático, es causado por nuestro sistema profundamente desigual y destructivo que se dedica a obtener ganancias para pocos, en vez de el bienestar de todos - no por personas comunes que luchan para sobrevivir en un mundo injusto. Las narraciones engañosas sobre la ""superpoblación"" pueden conducir a la promoción de la eugenesia o un estado de una sola raza logrado por políticas opresivas contra la inmigración.⁣
⁣
Ya estamos viendo cómo el fascismo se esta metiendo en muchos aspectos de nuestras vidas. Si vamos a luchar por un cambio que sea realmente justo ante la creciente crisis climática y ecológica, ¡debemos estar atentos contra el ecofascismo!⁣

⁣
‘Business as usual’ has been disrupted with a shocking jolt, and people everywhere are called on to do what we can to slow the progress of this pandemic.⁣

Advice from healthcare professionals and experts is to self-isolate and limit social contact to slow the spread of Coronavirus. Rebels are encouraged to hold meetings online wherever possible, and to think carefully before organising in-person gatherings.⁣
⁣
Slowing this virus down will make a big difference to how well we can care for people who are affected. By limiting our contact with others, where possible, we can relieve unnecessary strain on healthcare providers and save lives.⁣
⁣
As rebels, we can choose to engage with and support our local communities in this crisis. This is an opportunity to prefigure the world we want to build: one that chooses life and regeneration over despair and fear.⁣

⁣
Yesterday, XR groups all over the world took part in actions to highlight the disproportionate impact of the climate and ecological emergency on women⁣
and the resulting increase in violence, hardship and rape. The effects of climate breakdown are already been felt by our sisters in parts of the Global South. ⁣
⁣
A January 2020 report for the International Union for the Conservation of Nature found that climate breakdown and environmental degradation are driving an increase in violence against women, including rape. ⁣
⁣
UN figures indicate that 80% of people displaced by climate change are women.⁣
⁣
Globally, women are more likely to experience poverty, and to have less socioeconomic power than men. This makes it difficult to recover from disasters which affect infrastructure, jobs and housing. ⁣

#ExtinctionRebellion groups took to the streets for #InternationalWomensDay in Colombia, Chile, Spain, Turkey, The Gambia, Pakistan, Nigeria, Uganda, DRC, Belgium, Israel, The Philippines, Switzerland, Argentina and the UK. ⁣

“Tang Na is a joyful old lady, she has been living in Li Mountain village for 50 years since her marriage. 19 years ago, her husband broke his leg in an accident while working as a miner for a local company which soon went bankrupt. His labor was not fully paid, let alone the injury compensation.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Ever since her husband’s disability, Tang Na burdens all the labor inside and outside the house. Villagers here have been counting their livelihood on oranges for over three decades. When the harvest was decent, Tang Na had to carry 200 loads from field to home, around 20,000 kg.⁣⁣ ⁣⁣
However, since 2016, the harvest has been failing villagers’ hope because of unexceptionally heavy frost in winter.⁣⁣
Now there is only one family in the village still taking care of their orchids. But no one buys the oranges anymore, since they became too sour because of the weather. So the farmers have changed strategy to selling orange skins to Chinese medicine producers, and leaving the flesh to rot in the soil. Apparently, there is more work and less profit compared to old days. And it’s mostly women who are left in the village to deal with this low-profit work.⁣⁣ ⁣⁣
Traditionally, men are given more opportunity to flow and venture while women are stuck at home with kids and chores.”⁣⁣

I live in South Queens – very close to Jamaica Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. Hurricane Sandy completely flooded the neighbourhood right below us. It was insane to see homes completely destroyed; these are neighbours ors, friends, people I knew... and their homes were completely gone. After the hurricane I noticed these issues were effecting is directly, and they’re going to effect more people like us who live in vulnerable spaces. ⁣
⁣
This is happening as a result of corporations abusing their powers and governments who don’t want to put through policies that will help mitigate or end the effects of climate change... ⁣

Coming from Honduras, where climate change will be more impactful... knowing there’s already lots of poverty and violence there, I imagine what it will be like when there are more, stronger hurricanes hitting there. ⁣

⁣
Indigenous communities live in relative harmony with the natural world. However, the global economy currently profits from the domination of nature and the extraction of an unsustainable amount of natural resources — extracted from stolen indigenous lands.⁣
⁣
For centuries Indigenous people have been on the frontlines defending nature. ⁣
⁣
We must listen to indigenous voices, as they offer crucial insight about our connection to, and the protection of our natural world. We must also stand with indigenous peoples and defend their rights.⁣
⁣
“What governments around the world are doing is not correct. They aren’t respecting the planet. They aren’t respecting indigenous people. They aren’t even respecting their own laws that are written down. Please support us. Please pressure your government.”⁣⁣⁣

Climate change threatens 1 in 3 species of plants and animals in the next 50 years, according to @cnnclimate⁣⁣⁣ ⁣⁣⁣
⁣
Researchers from the University of Arizona “found that approximately one in three plant, insect and animal species could face extinction by 2070. However, things could be even worse if emissions continue to rise as rapidly as they have in recent decades”.⁣⁣⁣ ⁣⁣⁣
⁣
We are currently experiencing the Sixth Mass Extinction – currently losing up to 200 species per day. Five other mass extinctions have happened throughout the course of history, however the Sixth Mass Extinction is a direct cause of human activity.⁣⁣⁣ ⁣⁣⁣
⁣
According to the researchers, the number of species facing extinction could drop “if we make a collective effort to address climate change”. ⁣⁣⁣ ⁣⁣⁣

Rebels also drew attention to imminent threat of rising sea levels destroying the city itself. Some experts predict that Venice will be completely under water by the year 2100 due to rising sea levels and land subsidence (the sinking of the Earth’s surface caused by the removal of materials below the surface).⁣ ⁣

⁣
⁣
Trinity College is a college at the University of Cambridge in the UK. ⁣
⁣
This action was designed to highlight Cambridge Trinity College’s refusal to divest from the fossil fuel industry and their plans to tear up an ‘innocence farm’ in Kirkton and build a business park – despite local protests.⁣ ⁣⁣
⁣
⁣
BUT WHY DIG UP THE LAWN? ISN’T GRASS GOOD?⁣ ⁣⁣
⁣
⁣
No, not really. Trinity’s manicured lawn is a monoculture: no diversity.⁣ ⁣⁣
⁣
⁣
The college happily funds and destroys acres upon acres of actual habitats, destroying the homes of wildlife and people much poorer than themselves.⁣ ⁣⁣
⁣
⁣
The ‘pristine’ lawn is a status-symbol and nothing more. In Great Britain grass lawns have always been a way for aristocrats to show their wealth: excess land that they can afford to leave barren.⁣ ⁣⁣
⁣
⁣
Trinity College’s lawn can be repaired in a few days at a small cost in relation to their wealth – no humans or animals were hurt during this action. ⁣ ⁣⁣
⁣
⁣
On the other hand, the habitats that have been destroyed through Trinity College’s funding of fossil fuel projects are completely irreplaceable. ⁣ ⁣⁣
⁣
⁣
Temporary damage to the lawn of the UK’s third biggest land owner sparked media outrage –– imagine if the media was this concerned about holding the climate and ecological criminals to account…⁣ ⁣⁣

⁣
Rebels painted heartfelt messages on umbrellas inspired by the Indonesian proverb, 'Sedia Payung Sebelum Hujan' (meaning, prepare your umbrella before it rains.) This proverb is often used to urge action to prevent a bad thing from happening.⁣
⁣
#ExtinctionRebellion know that something catastrophic is already happening, but through collective action, we can PREVENT the worst from happening.⁣
⁣
The people of Indonesia are continuously urging their government to declare a climate and ecological emergency, and they will not stop until this has been achieved and adequate action has been taken to address it. ⁣

According to @guardian “this region stores about 70% of the world’s fresh water in the form of snow and ice. If it were all to melt, sea levels would rise by 50 to 60 metres, but that will take many generations. UN scientists predict oceans will be between 30cm and 110cm higher by the end of this century, depending on human efforts to reduce emissions and the sensitivity of ice sheets.”⁣

“The Hollywood sign is an iconic symbol of glamour and film history – but with Hollywood also comes a history of excess and discrimination, which are part of the roots of the climate emergency. Some stars of Hollywood are aware of the scale of the climate crisis, and some have started to take action… But we do not believe that Hollywood as a whole has taken an acceptable stance on the climate crisis.”⁣

Low oxygen levels are also associated with global heating, because the warmer water holds less oxygen.⁣ ⁣

When excess artificial fertiliser from crops, or manure from the meat industry, runs off the land and into rivers and seas, it feeds algae which bloom and then cause oxygen depletion as they decompose.⁣⁣

The problem of dead zones has been known about for decades, but little has been done to tackle it. Farmers rarely bear the brunt of the damage, which mainly affects fishing fleets and coastal areas. A few years ago, the meat industry in the US was found to be responsible for a massive dead zone measuring more than 8,000 sq miles in the Gulf of Mexico.”⁣⁣

I come from the Yorta Yorta people, an Indigenous tribe based two hours north of the city currently known as Melbourne, a colonial land. ⁣
⁣
The Indigenous people affected by these fires live many hours away from the cities. These are their custodial lands, which they’ve inhabited for 80,000 years. Indigenous people have an incredibly powerful physical and spiritual connection to the land, which has perished at the hands of mistreatment and neglect. It’s likely that First Nations people will be left out of the recovery process entirely, leaving many of these communities – who haven’t moved since colonisation – to flee to cities like Melbourne and Sydney. The direction of their lives will change forever, and their mental, social, and spiritual health will inevitably decline.”⁣

Ecologists at the University of Sydney predict millions potentially dead. This figure excludes bats, insects and frogs – meaning the true number is likely to be much higher. According to the researchers, the total number of animals affected nationwide may be as high as a billion.⁣
⁣
Wildfires are not new to Australia, but climate change has resulted in higher intensity and frequency – with wildlife on the frontline. According to @CNN ""Australia has the highest rate of species loss of any area in the world, and researchers fear that rate could increase as the fire disaster continues.""⁣
⁣
Animals all over the world are in trouble. We are currently experiencing a sixth mass extinction, caused by human overconsumption. Habitat destruction, overhunting and toxic pollution are all contributing to the crisis. Today, species are becoming extinct at a significantly faster rate than over the millions of years before. ⁣
⁣
We need to #ActNow to save our precious wildlife. If not now, when? Head to our stories to join the rebellion today. ⁣

The blood of murdered environmental leaders in Latin America are the seeds for a generation that is rebelling for life!⁣
⁣
This piece of activism was created to show respect for the environmental defenders murdered and persecuted in this decade, such us Paulo Guajajara (2019) and Berta Cáceres (2016) that were honored in this creation and will be always remembered. ⁣
⁣
Paulo was the first of this new wave of killings of indigenous people in Maranhão (Brasil) this year. A year marked by Ecocide in Brazil (Amazon fires, oil in the beaches, Brumadinho …) The community of life calls for help.⁣

Did you know that Brazil is one of the countries that killed more environmental activists in the world in the last few years?⁣
⁣
The defense of the community of life must be considered a human right, and today environmental activists do not have the proper legal instruments to preserve their integrity.⁣
⁣
What we are experiencing in Brazil today, and the case of Alter do Chão brigade members accused and arbitrarily arrested, shows us how the defenders are paying with their lives, their freedom and their rights. These are not only crimes against democracy, but also crimes against peace. All these crimes are connected.⁣

⁣
A tipping point is reached when the consequences of global warming are no longer able to be stopped. It was originally thought that extreme temperature increases of 5°C would take us past these tipping points, however new research has shown that this could happen between 1°C and 2°C of warming. ⁣
⁣
We have already risen temperatures beyond 1°C and are currently on track to rise beyond 2°C. ⁣
⁣
The consequences of this warming will most significantly effect those who have contributed the least carbon emissions. The wealthiest 10% of the global population produce half of the planet's individual-consumption-based fossil fuel emissions. In contrast, the poorest 50% of the global population are responsible for only 10%. This is why we must campaign for change.⁣

WHAT ARE OUR DEMANDS?⁣
⁣
1) TELL THE TRUTH⁣
Global governments must tell the truth by declaring climate and ecological emergencies, working with other institutions to communicate the urgency of change and instruct the public about the necessary changes.⁣
⁣
2) MAKE NECESSARY CHANGES⁣
Governments must enact legally binding policies to quickly stop biodiversity loss, reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero, make ecocide a crime against humanity and begin emergency planetary repair programs.⁣
⁣
3) FORM CITIZENS ASSEMBLIES Governments must create and be guided by legally binding decisions of citizen assemblies on climate, ecological and inter-generational justice.⁣
_____________________⁣
⁣
Citizens of Colombia have been on #NationalStrike for 9 days; their demands to the government of Colombia have been manifested and heard, however @xr_bogota_ still joined the #GlobalClimateStrike to demand that the necessary action is taken.⁣
⁣
Governments around the world have declared a ""Climate and Ecological Emergency"", but so far nothing has been done. We must ensure that these words are meaningful and that governments make the necessary policy changes. ⁣

Words from the photographer @gideonmendel ⁣
""Drowning World is an exploration of flooding using photography and video. My aim in this long-term project is to portray the human condition within the context of overwhelming climate events around the world. The subject matter has fundamentally challenged my practice: over the years there has been a shift from a traditional documentary approach to one that incorporates more conceptual and metaphorical elements alongside a deepening activism.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
In 2007 I photographed two floods that occurred within weeks of each other, one in the UK and the other in India. I was struck by the contrasting impacts of these floods, and the shared vulnerability that seemed to unite the people I encountered in this landscape.⁣ Since then, I have endeavored to visit flood zones around the world, witnessing a shared human experience of catastrophe that transcends geographical, cultural and economic divides.”⁣
⁣
The project now incorporates the UK (2007, 2014 and 2016), India (2007 and 2014), Haiti (2008), Pakistan (2010), Australia (2011), Thailand (2011), Nigeria (2012), Germany (2013), The Philippines (2013), Brazil (2015), Bangladesh (2015), the USA (2015, 2017 and 2018), and France (2016 and 2018).⁣⁣

Pelosi has acknowledged that “we must face the existential threat of our time,” but she has failed to introduce the climate emergency resolution. Time is running out, global governments need to act now. ⁣
⁣
Today, more than 400 people from 27 countries are on day 5 of the #GlobalHungerStrike⁣

This is a drastic and desperate action which aims to highlight the devastating impact that the climate and ecological emergency is already having on global food supplies, particularly affecting countries in the Global South where there is higher risk of drought. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
The hunger strikers are employing this last resort tactic after more than three decades of petitions, protests and campaigns have failed to secure the urgently needed responses to mitigate ecological and climate breakdown. By denying themselves their basic needs, the hunger strikers hope that their bodies will sound the alarm. ⁣⁣

Yesterday, Extinction Rebellion activists gathered outside the Brazillian Embassy to remember Amazon Guardian, Paulo Paulino Guajajara, who was recently assassinated in an ambush by loggers. Sadly, Paulo Paulino Guajajara is one of many Indigenous people, killed in the pursuit of corporate greed and environmental destruction. These are the people on the frontline of the climate and ecological crisis. ⁣

⁣⁣
The ongoing flood disaster in Derbyshire and Yorkshire has so starkly illustrated, our homes, businesses and families are at very real risk. We are watching, in real-time, as people’s lives are destroyed around the world and in the UK. Unless action is taken to halt biodiversity loss and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero these tragedies are set to worsen. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Scientific predictions of rising sea levels by 2100 range from less than 1 metre to as high as 5. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggest a rise of less than 2 metres, but past assessments have almost always underestimated the pace of climate change. The rate of melting Greenland ice sheets recorded this summer was not predicted until 2070. At its peak, this ice was melting at a rate of 140,000 tonnes per second – a total figure equivalent to 200 river Thames.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
The UK Prime Minister does not consider widespread flooding across the UK to be a national emergency. Extinction Rebellion disagrees. Many people in the UK, like many others around the world before them, have had life-changing experiences this week. We stand in solidarity with all of those who have lost their homes and livelihoods and will continue to demand action until the severity of this global emergency is realised.⁣⁣

1. The Indian Prime Ministers office set up a special panel to address the issue, within a few hours of the protest. The panel is due to report on the issue within 2 weeks.⁣
2. The Supreme Court of India asked the Central Government and respective state governments to fix the crop and waste burning issue of Dehli within a week. ⁣
3. The Center accepted that Green Fund will be used to combat toxic air pollution. ⁣
4. The Indian Prime Minister asked the Agriculture Ministry to distribute equipment urgently so that crop burning is no longer necessary. ⁣
⁣
Despite these promises, the air is still unsafe and activists will keep the pressure on until the air pollution reaches safe levels. ⁣
⁣
The protest was organised by a collaboration of movements; @xrebellionind @LetMeBreathe_In @FridaysForFutureIndia_ along with other activists. ⁣

⁣
Extinction Rebellion Brasil @rebellionextinctionbr are appealing for the global XR communities support, following a devastating oil spill in the largest biodiversity hot spot in the South Atlantic Ocean.⁣
⁣
No companies are yet to claim any responsibility for the incident, however the oil is still coming, and the locals don't have any government help. People are getting sick from cleaning hundreds of kilometres of beaches with their bare hands, and trying to rescue the animals suffocating in oil. ⁣
⁣
There has barely been any international reporting on the incident – XR Brasil are asking for people to contact their regional newspapers and ask them to report on this. The international community need to step up the pressure to force the president to act on this crisis. ⁣
⁣
The Amazon is still burning, the Pantanal and Cerrado are up in flames, Indigenous leaders being murdered, there were two more Guajajara forest guardians killed just this week – and now the coast is covered with oil.⁣
⁣
WHAT CAN YOU DO? ⁣
⁣
It's time for economic disruption of the industries ravaging Latin America. Join #BoycottForAmazonia for 1 year...⁣
⁣
Starting from the 1st of December, we are asking people to boycott products and services originating from conflict, deforestation and fire areas; these are especially beef, leather, soy, timber, sugar, gold and palm oil.⁣

In the ‘Declaration of Rebellion’ delivered to the Houses of Parliament, XR promised to continue acts of peaceful civil-disobedience until the government meet our demands. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
The demands are: ⁣⁣ 1) #TellTheTruth⁣⁣
Governments must tell the truth by declaring planetwide climate and ecological emergencies, working with other institutions, including but not limited to the media and education sectors, to communicate the urgency for change, and educate the public on the changes required, effectively acting in accordance to the truth. ⁣
 2) #ActNow⁣⁣
Governments must enact legally-binding policies and regulations to rapidly halt biodiversity loss, reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero, make ecocide a crime against humanity, and commence emergency programmes of planetary repair.⁣ ⁣
⁣
3) #CitizensAssembly⁣⁣
Governments must create and be led by legally binding decisions of Citizens’ Assemblies on climate, ecological and intergenerational global justice, for the above demands, including timelines for solutions and concrete plans of action, but not limited to the above demands.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Over the past year, countries all over the world have organised their own rebellions, adjusting the demands where necessary to compliment their own political system. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
We have seen hundreds of actions across the globe as well as two Worldwide Rebellions... and we’ve only just started. ⁣⁣

We are a global movement fighting for climate justice. To win, we need #EverybodyNow⁣⁣

The Kincade fire is burning across California. Residents have been using the world “apocalypse” to describe the raging fires, evacuation orders, forced power outages and terrible air conditions. ⁣
⁣
To the North, the Kincade fire spread across Sonoma county, where around 180,000 people have been evacuated. ⁣
⁣
Thousands of fire fighters are battling against the raging forest fires, but the fire has already burned an area twice the size of the city of San Francisco, destroying nearly 100 buildings. ⁣
⁣
In many continents across the world, communities are suffering the consequences of human-made climate change. Catastrophic weather events, forest fires, droughts and flooding are becoming more frequent; this year alone, we have seen devastating impacts across Asia, Latin America, Africa and the Arctic. ⁣
⁣
So many people are already suffering because of this crisis. If global governments don’t act now, these devastating events will only happen much more frequently. That is why we need #EverybodyNow to demand action; we need our governments to admit that we cannot continue with business as usual.⁣

""Saya lahir di satu kota yang dikenal dengan asap kebakaran hutannya. Kota ini adalah kota Pekanbaru di pulau Sumatra. Perjalanan saya dengan asap bermula sejak saya kecil, dan 25 tahun kemudian, asap-asap ini masih ada. Bahkan ketika saya pindah ke Jakarta, perjalanan saya dengan asap masih belum berakhir. Saya masih menderita dari asap-asap pembakaran bahan bakar fosil. Pemerintah telah mengecewakan saya dan semua orang. Itulah alasan saya memberontak.

Disabled XR rebels protested outside New Scotland Yard in London, against the confiscation of crucial accessibility equipment. This had made their intended protest, a basic human right, impossible. ⁣
⁣
The confiscation made protest inaccessible to disabled and neurodivergent rebels. Anyone standing with the disabled rebels were threatened with arrest on the grounds of assembly. The police refused neutral legal observers access during the arrest of the disabled rebels. Three were arrested in total, including the CEO of Inclusion London, which promotes equality for the deaf and disabled in the city.⁣

Unfortunately theres only around 60-75 people who attended due to the fact that, the climate crisis issue have basically never been in the public discussion realm in Indonisia at all, I would say majority of people here dont even know that the Forest Fire in Sumatera and Kalimantan going on right now is even more difficult to contain due to the longer summer, or the fact that the crop failures that have been going on in Java are due to Climate Change as well.⁣

The big polluters’ masterstroke was to blame the climate crisis on you and me. ⁣
⁣
A paper published in Nature shows that we have little chance of preventing more than 1.5C of global heating unless existing fossil fuel infrastructure is retired. Instead the industry intends to accelerate production, spending nearly $5tn in the next 10 years on developing new reserves. It is committed to ecocide.⁣
⁣
The ideology of consumerism is highly effective at shifting blame: witness the current ranting in the billionaire press about the alleged hypocrisy of environmental activists. This individuation of responsibility, intrinsic to consumerism, blinds us to the real drivers of destruction.⁣

It’s the system we need to change, rather than the products of the system. It is as citizens that we must act, rather than as consumers.⁣

The die-in performance involved rebels suffocating in vibrant clouds of ‘toxic’ gas, and was staged to draw attention to the crimes against humanity and the ecocide that the conference is facilitating.⁣
⁣
On its website the conference boasts of being a “platform” for countries across Africa to present oil exploration and other fossil fuel projects and “get deals signed”. No mention is made of the suffering stored up for the world’s most vulnerable with each new project undertaken.⁣
⁣
These omissions are especially conspicuous given the susceptibility of sub-Saharan Africa to climate breakdown, a topic that South Africa’s government and media has resolutely failed to tackle. This is still a landscape where new gas finds are celebrated and talk of ‘clean coal’ is left unquestioned.⁣

Here are just some of the incredible scenes from London @xrebellionuk yesterday, where actions included 200 mothers staging a mass nurse-in, to demand that the government protect their children in the face of this crisis. This action also intended to draw attention the the babies all over the world who have died due to reasons related to anthropogenic climate change.⁣
⁣
Highlights also included the planting of 1000 trees at Old Palace Yard. A tree has been saved for each MP to plant - so far, way over half the MPs have collected theirs. #ReforestEarth ⁣

Last year, 164 activists were killed in the Global South for trying to defend their lands from corporate extractivism. Yesterday, rebels all over the world held vigils to honour them, coming together in a global solidarity action.⁣
⁣
Images from Buenos Aires, @XRargentina where a large group walked to the UN building, holding a candle, and carrying a sign bearing the name of one of the 164 murdered activists.⁣
⁣
Remembrance ceremonies were also held in Santiago,  Islamabad, Dublin, Cape Town and London.⁣
⁣
The figure of 164 deaths is only an estimate. The real figure is likely to be much higher. Two indigenous activists are murdered every week for defending their lands from Western extractivist corporations, and their names are rarely known widely around the world.⁣
⁣
For those who have sacrificed everything, and for those who risk to loose everything... the rebellion continues.

We are truly sorry for all the delays and the inconvenience that the #InternationalRebellion is causing. However we need to use such nonviolent direct action tactics to put the issue at the forefront of public consciousness, in order to force the global governments to act now. ⁣

The disruption of a few major cities, for a short period of time, is nothing compared to the destruction anthropogenic climate change threatens to bring. ⁣

Just this year we have already seen terrible droughts in India, Australia and countries in Eastern Africa, Southern Africa and the Horn of Africa. Wildfires rage through Amazonia, Asia and the Arctic. Too many lives have already been impacted, even lost. We need to #ActNow for climate justice. ⁣

It’s important to understand that risking arrest is a huge sacrifice and a significant mark of privilege, not to be taken lightly. We completely understand that this is not an option for everyone. ⁣
⁣
Plenty of legal information can be found on our website if becoming an arrestable is something that you are considering. We strongly encourage you to read this information in-depth and attend one of our NVDA training sessions before making any decisions. If you’re a rebel who has been arrested at one of our actions, we thank you for your sacrifice.⁣

For those who are unable to risk arrest, there are plenty of other ways you can get involved, your support and presence is incredibly valuable to make this movement a success. ⁣

⁣
People in the Global South, for example, are increasingly at risk of extreme weather events, overheating, and food/water insecurities which has historically lead to conflict and forced migration. It is estimated that more that 140 million people in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Latin America will be displaced by 2050, due to climate breakdown.⁣
⁣
Even though Western societies have been responsible for the majority of anthropogenic (man-made) climate change, they are set to suffer the consequences at a lower intensity due to their geographic location and built infrastructure. ⁣
⁣
It is vital that global warming is kept below 1.5° in order to protect these communities from suffering even more catastrophic consequences. ⁣
⁣
This is why, on Monday the 7th of October we are taking to the streets. As a global movement we demand that our governments start listening to the science and #ActNow to tackle the #ClimateAndEcologicalEmergency ⁣

⁣
Fires in Indonesia, have been burning since July, as plantation owners burn land to turn jungle into plantation.⁣
⁣
Parts of Indonesia are now covered with a toxic smog made up of particles of tar, cyanide and carbon monoxide. This toxic cloud is spreading and has now reached Malaysia and Singapore. ⁣
⁣
The air pollution has reached hazardous levels, people are suffering with respiratory problems and emergency clinics have had to be set up to treat people. Doctors have warned about the long term health problems that exposure to the fumes will bring. ⁣
⁣
This is ecocide. Normal people have been suffering at the hands of corporations for far too long. For centuries, Indigenous communities have been sacrificing their freedoms, and often their lives, to protect the lands that are now being destroyed.  Now we must take to the streets in every part of the world to stand with them and demand an end to this. ⁣

“The Bristol wildlife filmmaking community aggregated yesterday in support of Greta Thunberg’s climate strike. We wore black and created coffins for critically endangered species and acknowledged our huge privilege in filming the many of the world’s iconic species and in many sites natural wonders, but also how they have been impacted and often even decimated over the years by human activities. There were 3 eulogies by wildlife filmmakers, professors and presenters before joining the main youth strike for climate on college green.” Deya was one of these speakers, reciting a eulogy for orangutans.

Illustration by @tollydollyposh ⁣
⁣
Coral reefs are highly important for biodiversity, coastal protection and reducing the damage of storms and hurricanes. Without the existence of coral reefs, countries such as the Maldives, Kiribati, Tuvalu and the Marshall Islands would not exist. Many sea creatures would also face extinction due to loss of habitat and food. ⁣
⁣
Coral reefs face many problems such as water pollution and overfishing. However, coral bleaching is one of the biggest threats to corals right now. ⁣
⁣
Corals are reliant on algae for sugars. In high temperatures the coral expels the algae which leaves the corals white in appearance. This is called coral bleaching and leaves the corals vulnerable to disease, often resulting in death.⁣
⁣
As sea water temperatures continue to rise, coral bleaching is a very prominent threat. According to the IPCC, “virtually all (>99%)” of coral is expected to die with 2°C of warming. ⁣
⁣
We need to #ActNow to ensure that this doesn’t happen. Join #ExtinctionRebellion today and take to the streets on October 7th. ⁣

⁣
Join groups around the world to demand that the United Nations act NOW — not by 2050.⁣
⁣
On the 21st September New York will host the Youth UN Climate Action Summit. Two days later the UN Climate Action Summit will take place whereby UN representatives will discuss ways in which countries around the world will attempt to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. ⁣
⁣
This target is neither urgent or ambitious. Therefore, @XR_Youth groups around the world have written letters to their respective UN representatives and will take to the streets on September 21st wearing blue, the colour of the UN. ⁣
⁣
DM your local XR Youth group on Instagram today for more details about the action and where/how to get involved! If they respond and say they haven't organised something then please email xrnewgold@gmail.com⁣

If you want to get involved, here are five different ways! ⁣
⁣
Approach your place of work and explain the gravity of the climate crisis. Encourage your employer to allow your company or team to take some time off to join the cause. Perhaps they will allow a whole day, or maybe just an early finish. If you're not sure how to request this, use our template to write to your employer. [LINK IN STORIES]⁣ ⁣
If you have annual leave allowance, you could book the day off work. Even one day could make a lot of difference. After all, what's one day vs. the future of the planet?! ⁣
⁣
Join the strike at lunchtime! ⁣
⁣
Of course, there may be plenty of other reasons that you are unable to strike. If this is the case but you still want to support, you could share the message on social media and encourage others who can to strike. ⁣

Tropical forests act as a carbon sink. When trees are destroyed not only do we lessen their carbon storage but they also release more CO2 into the atmosphere. ⁣

Causes of deforestation include logging, agricultural expansion, cattle ranching and infrastructure expansion. ⁣

In the UK, Extinction Rebellion’s third demand is that government must create and be led by the decisions of a citizens’ assembly on climate and ecological justice.⁣
⁣
Decades of inadequate political action have led to a climate and ecological emergency that poses an unprecedented existential threat to humanity and all life on Earth — “politics as usual” will not meet the challenge we face.⁣
⁣
“The fact that Extinction Rebellion is demanding a Citizens’ Assembly on the climate and ecological emergency is really what makes it unique. We’re not trying to assert our will on anyone else, and we’re not just crying out for action, we’re crying out for a very specific thing - we’re crying out for the UK public to have a say on how they respond to this emergency.” -Linda Doyle, Extinction Rebellion Citizens’ Assembly Working Group⁣

This is not just the future of Brazil he is holding in the balance - it’s all of our future.⁣⁣⁣

The Amazon's raging forest fires are so extreme that the smoke can be seen from space. The fires have been burning for three weeks.⁣
⁣
The Amazon rain forest covers an area of 6million km2 and spreads over nine countries.⁣
⁣
The Amazon homes a fifth of all of the world's species, including 15,000 types of tree. There are roughly 300 billion trees in the Amazon in total.⁣
⁣
Studies suggest that the Amazon absorbs around 2.2 billion tons of carbon dioxide a year, playing a crucial role in stabilising our climate.⁣
⁣
Indigenous groups living in the Amazon for thousands of years have been resisting the destruction of their ancestral home, often at the cost of their own lives. Their wisdom has been ignored by many, including Brazilian President, Jair Bolsanaro, who is prioritising Amazon resource extraction for economic gain.⁣
⁣
We must #TellTheTruth. It's time to #ActNow and take to the streets to stop the destruction of our precious ecosystems.⁣ On Friday 23rd August at 11am, we will gather outside our local Brazilian Embassies to demand urgent action against the destruction of this precious eco system.

Many companies want to enter everywhere but they do not help; they have come to damage the forest. Instead of going hunting, they cut down trees to make paths. Instead of caring for the forest, they destroy. Where the company lives, it smells nasty, the animals hide and when the river rises, the manioc and plantain in the low areas have problems. ⁣⁣

We respect the environment where we live. We like tourists because they come, and go away. When the company comes, it does not want to leave. ⁣⁣

Where the company has left its environment, we cannot return. It stays bad. ⁣⁣

⁣
Today celebrates significant progress and achievements worldwide for indigenous peoples and their rights. ⁣
⁣
The past 30 years have seen remarkable progress in the recognition of indigenous peoples’ rights, with important milestones being the adoption of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples by the UN General Assembly in 2007. ⁣
⁣
However we must not forget the threats and discriminations that indigenous peoples still face in their everyday lives. In many places laws are not fully implemented which can leave communities struggling for survival.⁣
⁣
Indigenous peoples manage around 50 per cent of the world’s land, but they only have legal ownership of 10 per cent. However, scholars and decision-makers are increasingly recognising that forests under indigenous peoples’ stewardship are less likely to be deforested and that indigenous peoples have a rich knowledge that can support sustainable development and climate action.⁣

We ask that instead the industry convene a People’s Assembly of industry professionals and designers as a platform to declare a Climate and Ecological Emergency, to face the truth and to take action following in the footsteps of The Tate and Culture Declares.” The BFC agree “We are facing a climate change emergency and all need to act” but we don’t see emergency action.⁣

We will not stand by while the natural world is being taken from beneath our feet. We will send a clear sign to the fashion industry that business as usual is leading us to extinction.",NA,NA,NA,6.84

Each year the deficit grows as demands increase. This year EOD has arrived earlier than ever, as the Earth struggles to replenish the seas with the fish we eat, forests that we burn and absorb the carbon dioxide we emit. ⁣

Facing the Climate Emergency alone can be overwhelming. As an individual, there’s only so much we can do to lower our personal carbon emissions - what we really need is for the world’s governments to act on this crisis. ⁣
⁣
The entire system needs reworking; for too long governments and corporations have put profit over people and planet. Extinction Rebellion are targeting those who have the power to make changes to the way society functions. ⁣

As individuals the most powerful thing we can do is come together. There will be no solution to eco-anxiety until we know that adequate action is been taken. ⁣

⁣
As part of last weeks #SummerUprising @xrebellionUK have announced a #TaxRebellion aimed at the Greater London Authority.⁣
⁣
⁣
The Mayor of London @sadiq declared a #ClimateEmergency in December, however Extinction Rebellion do not believe enough is being done to dramatically cut down on emissions. ⁣
⁣
⁣
Extinction Rebellion are asking Londoners to withhold 22% of one month’s council tax – the average proportion which would go to the GLA who are using this money to fund construction and other projects that are making the climate situation worse. ⁣
⁣
⁣
XR demand that the GLA immediately stop all infrastructure projects inconsistent with reaching carbon neutrality by 2025. XR also demands that the Mayor of London empowers a London’s Citizen Assembly to create an Emergency London plan, replacing the London 2020 plan. ⁣
⁣
⁣
All money withheld will be redirected to a Tax Rebellion Fund, managed by an independent body. Collection of funds will only begin once 2700 have pledged to join.⁣

A citizens’ assembly brings people together to learn, deliberate and make recommendations on an issue of public concern. 🗣
-
Similar to jury service, members are randomly selected from the population by a process called sortition. Quotas are used to ensure that the assembly is representative in terms of key characteristics such as gender, age, ethnicity, education level and geography. 📣 -

Assembly members learn about critical thinking before they hear balanced information from experts and stakeholders. The members spend time deliberating in small, facilitated groups and then they draft and vote on recommendations. ✍️ -

Citizens' assemblies are conducted by non-partisan organisations under independent oversight. They are transparent, inclusive and effective.

According to a study commissioned by @wwf today’s extreme levels of plastic pollution means that you may be ingesting around 5g of plastic per week - the equivalent of eating a credit card! 💳 -

The largest source of the plastic we are ingesting comes from the water we drink, with high traces found in tap water and even higher traces found in bottled water. 🚰

The report states that “since 2000, the world has produced as much plastic as all the preceding years combined, a third of which is leaked into nature.” 💧🌿

They know the cliff is there, they can see it, we can all see the cliff is there, but they’re too busy thinking about money, they can’t think about anything else. So in twelve years time, we might reach a tipping point, where we can no longer affect climate change and it won’t matter what we do. So we need to do something drastic and we need to do it now. 
The climate has always changed but in geological terms, over 100’s of 1000’s of years, it’s never changed this quickly or been pushed by one individual species on the planet.

The procession ended at Trafalgar Square, where a performance of Carmen at the Royal Opera House was being screened for the general public. 
XR fully supports the arts and especially when made accessible for all. However, BP can no longer be given such platforms for publicity by investing money in this sector in an attempt to disguise the ecocide that they continue to commit. 
The procession aimed to disrupt the BP sponsorship, but did not disrupt the screening of the performance for the public. 
We are currently facing a #ClimateEmergency which means that we can only burn less than an fifth of the fossil fuels that have already been extracted in order to keep global warming below 2 degrees. 
Despite this, @BP_PLC continue to explore for more fossil fuels, which can only be described as a criminal act.

We will gather on Cranbourne Street, outside Leicester square station and block the road. Setting up a catwalk across it. From this point, activists in drag will begin a parade with the support from both protestors and passers-by. This action will continue throughout the day, its aim to display the clear links between the LGBTQ+ community and environmental activism.

An Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF) study estimates there will be 20 million climate refugees in only 20 years and 200 million in only 50 years. It is statistically more likely for queer migrants or refugees to face discrimination in immigration and emigration processes. The BBC has reported physical and emotional violence in refugee camps and deportation for homophobic reasons from countries like the UK.

A True Colours United study has shown that LGBTQ young people are 120% more likely to experience homelessness than non-queer identifying youths. This makes them statistically more vulnerable to the dangerous weather conditions caused by climate breakdown. In the UK, we are already seeing flooding, dangerous, sometimes deadly, extremes in temperature in winter and summer.

The environmental crisis is a human rights issue. An issue that will disproportionately impact and cause the oppression of certain communities due to climate breakdown. As queer youths we feel it is our duty to stand up, and highlight this both within our community and beyond.

Extinction Rebellion Youth London is not aiming to disrupt Pride. Our action will take place alongside the march, but far enough away that it will not disrupt either the route of the march or those along the route. We feel as though we must take action on this day. #PrideisAProtest

According to a study by Rutgers University, sea levels today are rising at the fastest rate for 3000 years. 🌊 
Today global sea levels are roughly 5-8 inches higher than they were in 1900. For 2000 years before this, the sea levels had barely increased. Scientists agree that this is largely due to human activity. 🌊 
Sea levels started rising in the 1800s, shortly after we started burning fossil fuels. The increase in temperatures caused ice to melt and warmer waters to expand in volume. 🌊 
Rising sea levels pose a major threat for the 11% of the world’s population who live in areas less than 33ft above sea level. 🌊 
To minimise the catastrophic effects of rising sea levels we must #ActNow and avoid the global temperatures warming beyond 1.5 degrees.

The Extinction Rebellion Handbook is out today!!
....
It’s time. This is our last chance to do anything about the Global Climate and Ecological emergency. Our last chance to save the world as we know it. Now or never, we need to be radical. We need to rise up, and we need to rebel.
Extinction Rebellion is a global activist movement of ordinary people, demanding action from Governments all over the world.
.....
This is a book of truth and action. It has facts to arm you, pages to fill in and pages to rip out - alongside instructions on how to rebel, from organising a roadblock to facing arrest.

In 2017, a report by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation found that if the global fashion industry continues on its current growth path, by 2050, it could use more than a quarter of the world’s annual carbon budget associated with 2 degrees of warming... and yet, the industry continues to grow. 
To avoid catastrophe, we must disrupt it.

This is an emergency. We are witnessing climate and ecological breakdown. 
We will not significantly mitigate this crisis without total systemic change and a drastic reduction of our consumption. 
We must act now. 
We can no longer afford to use land to grow crops for producing clothes and extract oil to produce synthetic fibres. Enough is enough. Business as usual is leading us towards extinction. 
For the next year, we will engage in a boycott of the fashion industry and its ecocidal, unethical system of pointless production. We will take joy in making do with what we, collectively, already have. We challenge ourselves to radically change our relationships with clothes. 
We apologise to all those who may be adversely affected by this boycott. However, we continue firm in the knowledge that millions more will suffer and die from the environmental and social havoc wreaked by continued toxic production if we don’t disrupt it.

The natural world is at the foundation of our economy, our society, and everything we eat, drink and breathe - yet it is being eroded from beneath our feet. If people’s wages depend on the destruction of the earth, our life support system, we cannot simply carry on. We must demand deep systemic change that will transform how we sustain ourselves on this planet. That starts by saying no.

Follow @xr.boycottfashion to follow this movement and get inspired by how rebels are reimagining what clothing means to them. Go to the link in their bio to pledge to Boycott Fashion for 52 weeks.

Without bees we would be very hungry - they pollinate much of the crops and plants that produce our food. Thirty-five species of bees in the UK are facing extinction because of habitat-loss and pesticides. 🐝

- Sadiq Khan said he will be a bolder champion of action on climate change in London and internationally, and agreed to explore the idea of a Citizens’ Assembly.

On 27-28 April 2019 London Borough of Hillingdon were planning to cut down the roadside trees on Harvil Road. From early morning during those two days, 12 brave souls climbed the trees on the sides of Harvil Road and stopped the operation to cut them.

Over the last month more than 2000 trees have been felled in the area. Due to XR’s presence here, the works have stopped for now, though there is still a risk for the wildlife and ecosystems if these operations are carried forward.

“It is imperative that we keep on fighting. With true purpose to our fight and our action. And to make sure this spreads beyond the rebellion. This is an emergency. How many people are determined to go beyond their own lives? I want to learn to facilitate to help others grow so that every human being can act in ways that extend beyond their own lives. Yesterday I found myself picking up litter and doing things I wouldn’t ordinarily do. There is a fundamental shift happening, and this is exactly what humanity needs. On an individual level.”

This is the beginning of the beginning and everyone who was involved should know and be proud that they are catalysing a new-age environmental movement and opened up an international conversation about protecting the planet.
.
Today, following a meeting with @gretathunberg, the British government have agreed to meet with XR. This is a major step, but let’s keep this momentum going ✊🌎

As we spread our messages into physical space, in front of those who have not yet heard it, we must break the spell of business-as-usual.

#paintthestreets has now decentralised so beautifully, we invite Paintrunners and Truth Artists to NEVER STOP this action until the full truth of the crisis is known to all! We may create further concentrated weeks of action again like this in the near future.

Anyone can join at any level of commitment, and everyone can play their part -
From handing out flyers on street corners,
To slapping a few stickers on your way into work every day,
To standing up on the bus and speaking the truth to fellow passengers,
To replacing the adverts on train carriages and bus stops,
To performing in high streets and squares,
To flyposting to plaster our messages on the streets,
To spray-chalking stencils and slogans on the windows and walls of ecocidal companies,
To painting over advertisements and target buildings with the Extinction Symbol for hours on end until you are arrested, if you are prepared to risk your liberty for this cause.

Have you painted the streets yet?",NA,NA,NA,1.33

“The reason behind this action is that investing in fracking at this point in time is both criminally harmful to our futures as young people and is used to stall development in renewable energy technologies – solar, wind, battery storage, etc. “By convening and attending this conference the Westminster Energy, Environment and Transport Forum are promoting short term business over our generation’s future – as such, we will be blocking access to the conference to both stop such work and provide a clear message of what they are sacrificing for their profits. “This action is held in respect of the amazing work anti-fracking activists have done around the UK over the past few years – we stand with them and look to continue pushing the message that fracking is not a part of our future.” Picture by @earthwanderess

The #XRToplessTwelve moon politicians from the public gallery with their hands superglued to the glass, body-painted with Extinction Symbols and messages of truth.

The action comes just days after XR groups worldwide begin the international week of #PaintTheStreets, in which Rebels break laws and social norms using art and performance to #tellthetruth on the environmental crisis and call fellow citizens to arms for the #InternationalRebellion beginning April 15th.

The action was collaborated on by Rebels from the #XRTorrebels, #XRClimateGimps, #XRSomewhere, #XRSnowflakes and #XRCoracle affinity groups. The action included activists notorious for blockading petroleum and oil conferences and dinners such as the #Petroleum9 and the Scottish Oil Club 13.

Visitors in the public gallery laughed and cheered on as the #XRebels clowned their way around the benches, chanted, and loudly called out for people to look at the elephants in the room: two Rebels body-painted grey with elephant masks and “climate change” and “ecological collapse” written across their bodies.

Wake up and address the problem, @ukgov !

Quote from Savannah:
“We’re protesting the Government’s inaction on climate change and ecological collapse, and we are raising the profile of that - the biggest crisis that faces us all. I’m part of Extinction Rebellion, and we are rebelling. This is in preparation for the #internationalrebellion beginning April 15th.
We are going to be blockading the streets of London until they start talking about climate change, and come and negotiate our demands.” Savannah, one of the Knocker Blockers of the #XRToplessTwelve, was arrested after stripping down to her panties and throwing confetti in the air to distract the guards in the House of Commons, while the Glue Crew superglued their hands to the window of the public gallery with their butts facing the politicians.

From Sunday, March 24th until Tuesday, March 26th, thousands of activists settled on Trone square, in Brussels, close to the Parliament, to put pressure on politicians until they accepted to consider revising the constitution, to include a climate law.
The final vote will happen on Thursday, March 28th. 
Extinction Rebellion Belgium merged with different organizations for this action, such as Act For Climate Justice, Greenpeace, Youth For Climate, Students For Climate and others.

The possibility to review article 7bis has been approved with a narrow majority in the parliamentary committee!

We did it! Congratulations everyone! ✊

This is just a first step, the mobilization must continue until Thursday for the moment of truth on the climate law! The revision of the constitution will have to be voted in plenary session then.

Unchecked growth on a planet with finite natural resources is unsustainable.
The Government must enact legally-binding policies that include what individuals, communities and businesses need to do to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the UK to net zero by 2025 and take further action to remove the excess of atmospheric greenhouse gases and directly address all aspects of the ecological crisis. It must cooperate internationally to align global resource distribution with the health and sustainability of humanity and the ecology of the planet.

We cannot put the responsibility of the necessary changes on individuals.
For the change that’s needed on this massive scale, our governments must take responsibility and act on it.

“We are fast approaching the greatest catastrophe and tragedy in human history and most people have absolutely no idea.”
.
Each had their own story about why they joined the rebellion. One of the nine, Serena, states that “I’m grieving for my nieces and nephews because I care about their future. I’ve lived my life and I’m quite old now, but I grieve for them. They say, ‘you are leaving us a barren planet. Why have you left us this legacy?’ Unless people stand up like we are, nothing is going to change.”

Floods, wildfires, heatwaves, superstorms, and drought will become more common and get worse. Crop failure and the loss of clean fresh water will result - and it seems only then will politicians realise we cannot eat money.  Young people, who have done the least to contribute to the crisis, will suffer the most as the impacts of #climatebreakdown get worse over time.

When it comes to #climatebreakdown and #ecologicalcollapse, the situation is dire, and the science is done. Yet we do not set goals based on the limits of the current system; we set them based on the world we need. ⠀
The solutions to the #environmentalcrisis are out there - they have been for years, and more are being created and improved all the time. Our creativity knows no limits; its chains are this society's structures of power and injustice, and they must be broken. We will break them.⠀
We are a movement.⠀
We must move.⠀
We must walk towards that brighter place. ⠀
We must build that better world.⠀
One where all lives matter; one where we are equal, and where future generations are protected.⠀
#OurFuture is just within reach - every step and action we take brings us towards it. Then we need only grasp it and hold on tight. ⠀
So, where governments and corporations have failed us, we will rise up and rebel.⠀
For what we have lost, and what we stand still to lose.⠀
For those suffering and dying now.⠀
For our children.⠀
For the wild.⠀
For our planet.⠀

""This week I was one of nine activists arrested for protesting outside the International Petroleum Conference in London. ⠀
I didn’t set out to be arrested, I never have been before and I’m not here to endorse the act. 13 hours in a cell isn’t fun… But this is the action I chose to take because, frankly, I am terrified for the state of my future and we have run out of time. ⠀
The conference is an annual event in which all the biggest names in the gas and oil industry meet to network, discuss the future of their industry and figure out how to make more money. (That they really don’t need)⠀
Science clearly tells us that we must keep two thirds of fossil fuels in the ground if we are to curb carbon emissions and stay below a 2 degrees rise in temperature. However this is an industry that has no intention of stopping, an industry who have consistently focused on corporate profits and short term gain at the expense of our future. Just 25 companies are responsible for 50% of carbon emissions. Forget changing your light bulbs and having shorter showers, these are the real climate criminals. ⠀
Climate change is the greatest social justice issue of our time. 99% of climate related deaths occur in the world’s least developed countries even though those countries contribute to just 1% of emissions. The future will see extreme weather patterns, sea level rise, mass migration and disease. This may sound alarmist, and I wish it was, but it is unfortunately fact. Climate change is not something happening in the future, it is happening now, it is not just an urgent issue... it is an emergency.⠀
Whilst we can’t choose whether we will be affected by climate change (most of us will), we can choose whether we will be bystanders.""⠀

People fighting for our future, fighting for changes to stop climate change are getting arrested while the people and companies that are pumping out fossil fuels out of the ground are getting rich.
⛽️
I say Enough.
Enough of this toxic structure that is literally risking the survival of human kind as a species.
For what?! For money.
💸
Do you know what kind of world and society you want to live in?
Let me tell you what kind of word I dream of:
- A world where we cherish relationships and experiences over money, fame and status
- Where things are made to last, and where they can be fixed if they break rather than buying new
- A world where we work less and have more time for our friends, families and passions
- Where we don’t kill animals since we don’t need them to survive and thrive
- Where compassion is more desirable than a big house and fancy cars
- Where people’s well-being is not compromised for profit
🌻
What kind of world do you want to live in?
Thanks to @jackharries and all other activists who are part of @extinctionrebellion and are fighting for their, mine and your, future. I stand by you.

The severity of climate collapse is not being taught in schools.
We demand that those in positions of responsibility stop denying young people the truth and allow educators to teach it.

In most UK secondary schools, students will only learn about climate change in one or two modules in Geography, maybe in one RE lesson and in as few as four Science lessons. In the National Curriculum for Science the evidence for anthropogenic climate change is referred to as 'uncertain'. There is now an overwhelming body of evidence which makes clear that we are facing catastrophic ecological and societal breakdown if we do not take immediate and far-reaching action. We believe young people deserve the truth. They deserve the truth as a moral principle, but also because they need to learn what is happening, why it is happening and what they can do about it - they need to be empowered to face their future. Schools must also teach the reality of what we are all facing because this will hold the present generation of adults and leaders to account.

Our Rebellion cannot only seek to change the outside world. ⠀
We need a radical change within ourselves, in our relationships to each other, and to the natural world. ⠀
Regen means a deep commitment to self-care, and to preventing activist burnout, so that we can keep up the struggle. ⠀
Regen means taking time to rest and recover from the stress and drain of actions, learning and reflecting in order to plan the next one bigger and better. ⠀
Regen means being brutally honest with the crisis we are in, yet supporting those who are suffering because of these truths.⠀
Regen means holding grief for the losses we have suffered, and those we have yet to suffer. ⠀
Regen means striving for the best, and yet preparing for the worst - the collapse of civilisation as we know it. ⠀
And should the worst come to pass, it means forming a movement of resilient people deeply prepared to pick themselves back up. ⠀
A community of those ready to rise from the ashes of that broken world, adapt, and build a better future - no matter how hard the struggle.⠀
We will not give in.⠀

This Sunday we swarmed @LondonFashionWeek, grinding #London's traffic to a halt again to disrupt the shows by delaying the arrival of key personnel.

This is not a drill. We are in the midst of a climate and ecological emergency and we need every industry - especially one with the cultural influence of ‘fashion’ - to transform, to wake up and to become a force of social and political change.

Instead of leading us towards a sustainable future, the fashion industry is doing little to cut its own greenhouse gas emission footprint which right now is the same size as Russia's. 
We met with #BritishFashionCouncil and we hope to work with them to transform the industry into one that is compatible with a sustainable future and a liveable planet for future generations. Their practices of worker exploitation, massive pollution (such as microfibres), and unsustainable mass production (1kg of #cotton takes 10-20,000 litres of water to produce) are largely fed by encouraging a growing trend of fast fashion, where people buy more clothes, wear them less often and throw them away faster when they're #outoffashion. In the context of ecological collapse, the #waste involved is shameful. Clothes shouldn't cost the Earth. The fashion industry have a huge influence and garner great respect, and we are asking them to use it to lead by example.
During World War II the industry was revolutionised to help protect this country. Now, when our entire planet is under threat, we need that bold leadership again. What do you think designers and clothing brands could do to improve their social and environmental footprint?  #LFW #swarming #ExtinctionRebellion #londonfashionweek",NA,NA,NA,-1.26

Extinction Rebellion protests to disrupt London Fashion Week with ‘swarming’ roadblocks. ⠀
Extinction Rebellion sent a letter to the British Fashion Council calling on it to “use its influential position to tell the truth about climate change … [The fashion industry] is a powerful engine of culture and could be a revolutionary force for change”⠀
British Fashion Council failed to respond to Extinction Rebellion’s letter, asking it to tell the truth about the climate and ecological emergency we are in, and to end ‘business as usual’. ⠀
⠀
With daily news worsening about the climate breakdown that is happening across the world, this action is part of a wave of civil disobedience building momentum towards Extinction Rebellion’s International Rebellion which begins Monday 15 April.⠀
Full press release on our website.⠀

""CHRISTIAN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ACTIVISTS IN WEST AFRIKA LINKING INTO EXTINCTION REBELLION⠀
Members of the Catholic Youth Organisation (CYO) in Accra, Ghana met to resolve to promote the Laudato Si Appeal and Pledge of Pope Francis as their contribution, not only to the laudable efforts of the Global Catholic Climate Movement (GCCM), but also to advancing the cause of Extinction Rebellion (XR). Facilitated by a CYO Team led by Kosi Elorm Agorkor, with assistance from the XR Activist Mawuse Yao Agorkor of VAZOBA, the meeting agreed to establish a Communion Action Link for Laudato Si (CALLS) as its spearhead working group to liaise with and popularise in Ghana the endeavours of relevant Environmental Justice formations, like the GCCM and the Christian Climate Action (CCA) in the United Kingdom, as well as seek to harmonise some of its activities with the Stop the Maangamizi and Extinction Rebellion Joint Action Provisional Interconnexions Council for West Afrika (SMERJAPIC-WA). See more pictures on the GILOGCAL Facebook Page.⠀

This 'Posubannufafia Outpost Banners Flylearning Action' in Agomenya Market was led by Maatyo Dedo Azu, who is pairing together with Mawuse Yao Agorkor for both of them to serve as the Co-Facilitating Coordinators of the  SMERJAPIC-WA. Dedo was ably assisted in successfully leading this Agomenya Market Flylearning operational exercise by Akweley Azu, a SMERJAPIC-WA Activist who is also the Principal Organising Secretary of the long Environmental Justice-campaigning local organisation known as the Krobo Community Regeneration for Sustainable Development Action Forum (KCORSDAF).""⠀

 We massively appreciate @earthstrike2019 for bringing the hugely effective tactic of workers' strikes to the table for environmental and system change issues. We're looking forward to taking part in more of their demonstrations, particularly their GLOBAL Earth Strike beginning September 27th this year. Take your working hands with us on that day and raise them into fists, for people and planet!

BREAKING TODAY: 3 members of Extinction Rebellion have glued themselves to the turnstiles as part of the ‘Blockade the Coal Burglars’ action, organised by Phulbari Solidarity Group and in collaboration with @ReclaimThePower.
 As a result, the AGM of Global Coal Management Resources Plc, a London-based AIM-listed extractive company that wants to build a massive open-pit coal mine by forcibly displacing 130,000 families of farmers in Phulbari, has been cancelled. 
Police called in glue removal equipment, and the XR volunteers including some of the #XRSnowflakes were arrested. #conscientiousprotectors  The new coal mines in Bangladesh would see thousands of local farming families displaced from their land, and their water sources polluted. This also goes against clear scientific proof that we must leave all fossil fuels in the ground to stay within safe warming targets, particularly coal, the most polluting of all fossil energy sources. All this immoral destruction for the sake of profit for a foreign company.
GCM's plan is another shameful example of how the environmental and social costs of neoliberalism and unsustainable economic growth are overwhelmingly heaped on the poor, people of colour, and those in the Global South. 
We won't stand for it - not here, and not in Bangladesh. #rebelforlife

⠀
Where is the @BBC when we need it most? ⠀
In World War Two, the public service organisation stepped up to the challenge of fascism and broadcast the truth to the world. Today's emergency - runaway global warming and the catastrophic loss of biodiversity - is even greater. It is the biggest challenge humankind has ever faced.⠀
⠀
Instead of using its huge influence, its global reach and its public service mission to rise to the occasion, it has been failing us with patchy and half-hearted coverage. All too often it has cowed to the denialists. Meanwhile its BBC pension system is still mired in the dark ages of fossil fuel investment and toxic bankers like @Barclays.⠀
⠀
So as the taxpayers who fund it, we're taking back the British Broadcasting Corporation, for Britain - for its people, not for the rich and polluting who influence mass media.⠀
⠀
Join us tomorrow at BBC headquarters around the country to demand that the BBC News fulfil its duty as a public service broadcaster.

Beautiful set of actions by XR Cambridge on #regionalrebellionday. ⠀

About 200 people joined Cambridge Rebellion Day on 15th December 2018. Die-ins were staged at two major shopping centres and the Declaration of Rebellion was read at the Guildhall (City Council HQ). Speakers described how climate breakdown is affecting food security and communities in the Global South as well as the impact on wildlife. 
Three coffins representing Our Future, Ecocide (destruction of the natural environment) and Climate Victims including those killed already, refugees and more, were carried through Cambridge and laid at the door of Shire Hall (Cambridgeshire County Council HQ). One of the coffins was then buried in the council's lawn opposite during a moving ceremony, at which an apple tree representing hope was also planted. The XR symbol and the phrase ""RIP"" were spray painted onto Shire Hall to express our collective anger at the County Council's seeming lack of interest in the climate emergency and to encourage them to take notice of and act on the crisis. No arrests were made. 
A petition asking the city council to Declare a Climate Emergency collected 263 signatures during the day. Afterwards the cold & tired protesters were generously invited into a nearby church for hot drinks and mince pies.

M. Nasheed, ex-president of the Maldives speaking from #COP24:⠀
⠀
""We have called this press conference because we are not at all happy with the way these talks are going. ⠀
⠀
The Maldives, representing AOSIS, and Ethiopia, representing the LDCs, and others, are not happy at all. ⠀
⠀
We are well over 100 countries, are we are deeply unhappy with the lack of progress. ⠀
⠀
We all understand the dangers that climate change poses. ⠀
⠀
The IPCC Special Report on 1.5°C is clear: if we allow temperatures to shoot past 1.5 degrees, every single nation at these talks will have hell to pay. ⠀
⠀
But at the moment, we are on track to shoot well past 3 degrees. ⠀
⠀
For some of us, on the frontlines of climate change, we face extinction.⠀
⠀
Extinction not just of our coral reefs, or our ecosystems… but of our entire homelands. ⠀
⠀
We are not prepared to allow that to happen.  We are rebelling against extinction. And if necessary, we will rebel against these talks. ⠀
⠀
Specifically, we want to see the following: Firstly, COP 24 must accept the findings of the Special Report and identify a way forward for Parties to translate its science into action. The reason is very simple: you can’t cut a deal with the laws of physics, and we don’t intend to try. ⠀
⠀
Secondly, we want to see countries commit to strong, new NDCs, so we catch up with what the science demands of us. This Conference needs to lay the groundwork, to enable countries to increase mitigation efforts. We need a clear COP decision, stating that COP24 is committed to a process to strengthen the NDCs. ⠀
⠀
⠀
And thirdly, we need to mobilize finance for developing countries, especially SIDS and LDCs, who are on the climate frontlines and already reeling under the impacts of warmer world. ⠀
⠀
The science is clear.  At these talks, we must show that we are responding to the science. ⠀
⠀
We are not prepared to allow the UNFCCC process, to put small islands and vulnerable countries on a pathway to extinction.""⠀

At no time of year is this more obvious than around Christmas, where we have been pushed to believe that we show the strength of our love for others by buying things - rather than spending time or effort with our families and loved ones. ⠀

This Christmas, we ask you to consider how you celebrate with your family. Is it right to do so in showers of plastic, giving gadgets, toys and nick-nacks that will be thrown away in days or weeks? Consider creating something with love from your own hands - paint, write, or sing for them, anything but the nothing we wrap in paper only to end up in landfill.

I hold life and death sacred, I am dedicated to non violent disruption of the thinking, lack of feeling and dominant systems that have created this disconnection from our true nature and authentic relationship with each other."" ⠀

This morning at the end of the M4 at Earl's Court we faced adversity and aggression from early morning motorists. The common retort was the 'selfish' inconvenience we'd caused.
.
""I don't want to be here,"" said Simon from Extinction Rebellion.
.
Our fingers were cold. Our bodies felt tired. We were facing hundreds of angry civilians. But we were there because we care. So deeply and passionately that we can't be anywhere else right now. And we can't sit by and watch as our Government continues to ignore climate change, overlooking a safe future for our children.
.
Keep the Rebellion alive. Share our story, speak your truth, join our events, and make a stand for what is good and necessary on this planet right now.

✊ REMINDER — TOMORROW — 7am — ACTION — JOIN US — HELP US KEEP UP MOMENTUM ✊ 
Westminster | London Bridge | Elephant & Castle | Earl's Court

Extinction Rebellion continues this week in peaceful, civilly disobedient, non-violent 'SWARMING ROADBLOCKS' — demanding URGENT action and the declaration of a CLIMATE EMERGENCY from the Government. HELP US be HEARD.
.
📅 EVENT ON FACEBOOK: Rebellion Swarming https://www.facebook.com/events/2196665013947690/
.
📅 Twitter: https://twitter.com/ExtinctionR; Hashtag: #ExtinctionRebellion

The ‘swarms’ aim to cause gridlock across the capital - causing economic disturbance to show the government we are serious. A short inconvenience for the public will save us all a HUGE inconvenience in the years to come.
.
----------------------
.
The Extinction Rebellion (XR) was declared at Parliament on October 31st 2018. Time has almost entirely run out to address the ecological crisis which is upon us, including the 6th mass species extinction and abrupt and runaway climate change. We have 12 years to drastically change our ways, the government must make real action NOW. Societal collapse and mass death are seen as inevitable by scientists and other credible voices, with human extinction also a possibility, if rapid action is not taken.

Extinction Rebellion believes it is a citizen’s duty to rebel using peaceful civil disobedience when faced with criminal inactivity by its authorities. The Rebellion centres on demands for Government to tell the truth about our dire situation and to act accordingly, including to decarbonise our economy by 2025, in a mobilisation of wartime-like proportion. A Citizens Assembly will oversee the transition to a world which would be far more beautiful, less frenetic and with meaningful work for all. [Credit: Johnny Pickup]

They face unprecedented charges for a non-violent action that took place at Stansted airport, which prevented a charter flight bound for Ghana and Nigeria from taking off.⠀

This intervention exposed the Home Office's racist and unjust deportation programme, in which people are being removed from their families and communities by force and without due process. On that night in March 2017, the flight included asylum seekers and victims of human trafficking, who were at risk of persecution and death if deported. One person on the plane has since been granted leave to remain and others are still in the UK, with ongoing claims, due to the courageous and selfless act of these 15 citizens.⠀

We believe that intervening was the right thing to do. People would be shocked if they knew the full extent of this secret practice. This appalling abuse of state power must stop.⠀

A member of Christian Climate Action affinity group arrested at the Brazilian Embassy roadblock protest last night, showing disapproval for far-right president Bolsonaro. 
Bolsonaro is backed by the agricultural lobby, and threatens to sell ""every last centimetre"" of the Amazon and Cerrado ecosystems. These are crucial biodiversity hotspots home to thousands of species and hundreds of indigenous communities, such as the Yasuni of Ecuador whose land is currently at risk.

Bolsonaro's hate speech has also legitimised countless violent crimes against members of the LGBT community, including several murders. So we threw a big queer party outside the Embassy in his, ahem, honour.

Tomorrow we take to London's streets to show that just like the Brazilians chanted as they marched through Sao Paulo, no one is giving in.

If you want a future, we'll see you on the bridges tomorrow.

Over 500 people have signed up for arrestable actions of mass disobedience this week as part of the #ExtinctionRebellion, flooding police capacity and bringing London to a standstill. Actions will continue until the government finally hears its people, and begins taking action to transfer to zero-carbon by 2025.

Protests are non-violent and activists do not run or resist arrest.
They give up their freedom, for our planet.
Some will say they give for nothing.
They give because we have no choice.
But no matter how much they may lose, there is no greater loss than that which we will face in just a few short years if we do not act now against climate change.
They give their everything, for our everything – our planet.
There is no greater cause to stand for.

Whilst we must all make changes in our individual lives it is up to our government to create policy and a framework that puts planet over profit.

To the speakers, and the singers, and to those who watched the live stream and listened to our declaration of rebellion. Thank you. We are a huge, diverse, growing movement and we are so, so grateful to every single one of you.

Today, over 1000 people gathered at Parliament Square and occupied the road for two hours as an act of nonviolent protest. Hundreds of people took part in the roadblock, including Caroline Lucas, George Monbiot, and fifteen year-old climate activist #GretaThunberg.

15 people were arrested, including Donnachadh McCarthy, founder of the The Climate Media Coalition. As conscientious protectors who are happy to be arrested, we have planned for this. We will support them as best we can and legal advice continues.
But this is just the beginning.

#ExtinctionRebellion is planning a series of disruptive actions from 12th November, leading to Rebellion Day on 17th November. We are holding the UK government accountable for their criminal inaction on climate breakdown. Support is growing faster than we ever expected. So, get involved now.

Come along to a training day in London. Details in biog☝️☝️",NA,NA,NA,-6.59

The circle signifies the planet, while the hourglass inside serves as a warning that time is rapidly running out for many species. The world is currently undergoing a #MassExtinction event, and this symbol is intended to help raise awareness of the urgent need for change in order to address this crisis. Estimates are that somewhere between 30,000 and 140,000 species are becoming extinct every year in what scientists have named the #Holocene, or #SixthMassExtinction. This ongoing process of destruction is being caused by the impact of human activity. Within the next few decades approximately 50% of all species that now exist will have become extinct. Such a catastrophic loss of biodiversity is highly likely to cause widespread ecosystem collapse and consequently render the planet uninhabitable for humans.' The destruction is being caused by our climate wrecking governments and the corporations that they represent rather than us and our planet. We must #RiseUp, #Resist and #Rebel.

Shot in cold blood, no chance to fight
The stage is set, now pay the price
An ego boost, don't think twice
Technology, the battle's unfair
You pull the hammer without a care
Squeeze the trigger that makes you man
Pseudo-safari, the hunt is canned
The hunt is canned... All are gone, all but one
No contest, nowhere to run
No more left, only one
This is it, this is the #CountdownToExtinction

Tell the truth, you wouldn't dare
The skin and trophy, oh so rare
Silence speaks louder than words
Ignore the guilt, and take your turn
Liars' anagram is ""lairs""
Man, you were never even there
Killed a few feet from the cages
Point blank, you're so courageous
So courageous... All are gone, all but one
No contest, nowhere to run
No more left, only one
This is it, this is the countdown to extinction

One hour from now, another species of life form will disappear off the face of the planet... forever. And the rate is accelerating

All are gone, all but one
No contest, nowhere to run
No more left, only one
This is it, this is the countdown to extinction'

#RisingUp is coordinating a Nonviolent Rebellion in November this year against 30 years of criminal inaction by the the UK Government on the #ClimateEmergencyand #ecologicalcompound risis. The science is done - we are now heading for extinction. The time has come to take radical and serious political action.

We are holding a hundred talks and workshops all around the country to mobilise people to take civil disobedience in November which will lead to arrests and possible imprisonment, and to help with the many essential support roles. We intend to provoke a national debate on what we are doing to the planet and the world we are creating for our young people. We demand that the government reduces carbon emissions to zero within the next decade and aim to set up national assembles of citizens to replace our corrupted political institutions.

Quick reminder of the events coming up this week. If you can’t make it to any, make sure to invite your friends and family!

CORNWALL: Two of our “Climate Change – Why we are heading for extinction and what to do about it” talks – one in PENZANCE on Monday https://www.facebook.com/events/1185398791603111/ and one in PORTHTOWAN on Tuesday https://www.facebook.com/events/319501621952702/ . Rising Up Cornwall is still fairly new in the region so please invite all your Cornish friends to the event!

LONDON: In addition to our general meeting on Wednesday https://www.facebook.com/events/418704611956806/ , we will be having our first ROAD BLOCK followed by a picnic on Thursday. https://www.facebook.com/events/296752167804536/ This will be a practice round for us to get a taste of direct action in action. Even if you don’t want to block the road yourself, there will be plenty of other jobs to do so come along and bring some friends with you!

BRISTOL: The usual weekly social and rebellion plotting on Tuesday – don’t give it a miss!
https://www.facebook.com/events/1921778854786494/

#RisingUp is coordinating a Nonviolent Rebellion in November this year against 30 years of criminal inaction by the the UK Government on the #ClimateEmergencyand #ecologicalcompound risis. The science is done - we are now heading for extinction. The time has come to take radical and serious political action.

We are holding a hundred talks and workshops all around the country to mobilise people to take civil disobedience in November which will lead to arrests and possible imprisonment, and to help with the many essential support roles. We intend to provoke a national debate on what we are doing to the planet and the world we are creating for our young people. We demand that the government reduces carbon emissions to zero within the next decade and aim to set up national assembles of citizens to replace our corrupted political institutions.

The scientific evidence is overwhelming and stark, we are hurtling towards a brick wall and the brakes aren't being applied. It is our moral duty to fight for life on Earth. We are choosing to rebel and make plain our demands for change. This will involve disruption and peaceful law breaking - to sound the alarm at level 10.
